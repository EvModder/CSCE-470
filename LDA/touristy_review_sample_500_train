Being that Burger King is one of the only places open really early, I chose it.  Plus, I enjoy their breakfast items.  \n\nI know it's come to be commonplace to expect poor service at fast food restaurants, but...why?  I worked in fast food in my younger days and provided quality service.  I was quick, I was knowledgeable, I was friendly, and I was attentive.  Is that really too much to ask?  If you can't make it in fast food...where can you make it?  \n\nAnyway, I stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast.  I stepped up to order when it was my turn, and after the co-worker next to him finished talking to him...or at least took a break.  I placed my order and then stepped down the line to await my order.  I looked around and saw chutes full of pre-made sandwiches sitting under the warming lamp.  Employees were congregated in the back talking.  And more employees were congregated around the register talking.  Nobody was working except for the cashier, and even he was doing a half-assed job.  The cashier abandoned his register and came over to fill the first guy's order.  He then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order.  Some jerk-off airport employee behind me \"kindly\" offered to take the coffee I had just been poured so I could get a \"fresh\" cup.  Thankfully, the BK employee continued to give me my cup of coffee.  \n\nThe food was good and still semi-warm, but is it too much to ask that people do their jobs while on duty?  Do you really need 10 BK employees standing around doing nothing?", "business_id": "X-uPUUV7xPiKivsQzJD-wg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2010-11-17", "length": 308, "open": 1}

Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.\n\nOne of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.  \n\nThis time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary. \n\nThey have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.

We got a room to ourselves, and dedicated wait staff. The staff was friendly, and attentive.\n\nI admit that I didn't try the appetizers because I could tell there would be a lot of food. I had one of their biscuits, which was fluffy and tasty with the sweetened butter they served it with. \n\nMy dirty K.O. martini was tasty, too. They had a crudite plate (raw veggies) that was less than appealing... just some sticks of jicama, carrots, black olives and radishes rolling around in a bowl that looked like a horse trough. The quesadillas they put out looked really good, though, and people enjoyed them. I tried half of a grilled portabello mushroom app, and while tasty, it was grilled a bit too much and was a little tough. Flavor was good, though.\n\nFor dinner, I had the half-rack of baby back ribs. They were VERY good. The mashed potatoes weren't that hot anymore, so they had gotten kind of hard on top. I understand it's hard to cook for 24 people, and have the food arrive around the same time, but it seems like they could've waited to slop your potatoes on the plate until before they were going to serve them up. The meat was tender and very tasty on the ribs. I could only eat half of a half. Gave the rest away... if I had a fridge at the hotel, it would've gone with me!\n\nCouldn't even fathom dessert. The food was plenty enough for me! \n\nThe ambiance was nice. Would've been better if there weren't smoking allowed in the lounge part of the restaurant. That was the worst part of the experience. Being from California, I\"m not used to having to smell second hand smoke while eating anymore. \n\nIt may have been a better experience if we didn't have 24 people...

Its just above average.\n\nAnd this is quite a resort.  I am personally not a fan of the mega huge family resort; mainly because its so hard to find your way around and it takes forever to get from point A to point B.  When its 115 degrees out these walks are particularly trying.  \n\nChecking into the resort left less than a favorable impression on me.  I was laden with a heavy suitcase, laptop bag, as well as my husband's suit and my dress.  After I helped other guests sort out the line situation (seriously, why would you stand around in a huge crowd? Form a line!)  I asked the desk attendant to call a bell hop to take my bags to my room because it was a considerable walk away.  \"Oh, you can just go down that flight of stairs out to where the valet is and find a bell hop.\"  Hmm, ok, no.  If I wasn't laden down with bags perhaps I could walk down the steps but I have all this heavy stuff which is why I asked for the bell hop in the first place!  How does a front desk not call a bell hop for you?!  As I later found out I was supposed to receive a welcoming package from my husband's company that the front desk failed to give me.  Stellar.\n\nOur room was nice and large; they are all suites.  The room service menu has to be the most reasonably priced room service menu ever.  Some of the items were cheaper via room service than in the restaurants!  Our room overlooked an \"adult pool\" that had kids swimming in it.  This really grinds my gears...especially when the resort has a waterpark!  The waterpark is an experience....there are kids everywhere, three slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool.  Its all on a small scale.  They have two restaurants at the \"Oasis\" which both serve the same menu.  At night when the slides close they show a movie over the wave pool area.  \n\nThe formal events (dinner and receptions) that we attended were well done, the food was good in all instances.  The bartenders were very nice and quickly learned the drinks we were ordering.  \n\nWould I stay here again?  No, not if it wasn't for a business event.  Would I suggest it to friends visiting?

YES we arrived at 5:45 PM and dinner got to the table by 7:00 pm the restaurant closes at 8:00 PM (RATED: WORST)\n\n3) Food Quality and Presentation - As soon as the food arrived thinking ahead perhaps ordering the second round of ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH & CHIPS might be a good idea since our first serving took over 30 minutes. But taking the first bite confirmed we just entered The Kitchen from HELL - burned fried fish all dried out and crunchy not even close to eatable.  Hungry as we were trying to find just a small portion of fish that was not over cooked was like digging for gold in a dried out mine. (RATED: WORSE THAN WORSE)\n\n4) Responsiveness and knowledge of servers - NEVER ask for seconds in this restaurant if you don't want your head bit off by a YELLING waitress saying she's been working since 10:00 AM and that we should not complain about waiting since she was tired. Perhaps the waitress had a bad day but yelling at customers who came for ALL YOU CAN EAT our expectations are at least that we could get a 2nd round of Fish and hopefully not dried out and burned to a crisp.  Any waitress that yells at customers perhaps should find a less stressful job like get an office job or just stay at home and make babies. If the kitchen is too hot then get out. Or as Donald Trump would say YOU'RE FIRED! (RATED: IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE THAN WORSE)\n\n5) Noise level - ambient - Normally when the customers are chatting it can be noisy but when the ENTIRE restaurant stops talking because a raving waitress is YELLING at hungry and very patience customers....that NOISE LEVEL is just unacceptable . (RATED: IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE THAN WORSE)\n\n6) Return Visit?

(I think changing a tire in the middle of B.F.E. was responsible for that. Lug nuts don't turn too well when your fingers refuse to follow your brain's orders because the wind chill's enough to make a grown man cry...and then freeze those futile tears to his cheeks.)\n\nSo we were super psyched at the prospect of sleeping in our own beds and enjoying positively balmy 50 degree weather. And what better way is there to celebrate than with a quick stop for a piece of pie?\n\nRock Springs Cafe off the I-17 is just what the sweet tooth ordered. \n\nJust don't depend on them to satisfy much else.\n\nThe good thing is that road weary folks fit right in among the multitude of families that frequent the place. I mean, it's out in the middle of pretty much nowhere (Black Canyon City region) so truckers and kiddos are forced to coincide in harmony. And man was that place crawling with kids. Not my cuppa, but the Wild West General Store and Saloon environment with antiques covering the walls is certainly the kind of place where kids will have a ball, so consider stretching your legs here if you're on a road trip with the little ones.\n\nWell, provided you can get a seat to begin with. The wait staff consists of small town folks that really seem to dislike their jobs. They're either 60+ or 16. We waited a good ten minutes or so to be seated because all the waiters and waitresses only had eyes for their current customers, and the hostess had apparently taken an extended smoke break. Unfortunately, once we were seated we realized that while the waitress did only have eyes for her customers, they were evil, evil eyes. She was a crotchety old granny figure that looked disapprovingly upon every decision we made. \n\nThe food was pretty sucky. We ordered the fish sandwich, tuna melt and open face hot roast beef and came to the general consensus that yeah, it's edible. Not ten bucks an entree worth of edible, but it's too late to rectify that now. The fish had to be a freeze dried puck that was fried double its cooking time. The gravy for the beef had to be reconstituted from powder, naturally to accompany the mound of what used to be potato flakes. The tuna melt was flavorless and the fries were probably freezer burnt. It was a food-like product, probably reflecting the fact that it was out in the middle of BFE and they subsisted off a biweekly frozen food shipment.\n\nBut the pie! Jack Daniel's Pecan, Tennessee Whiskey Lemon, and you're good. Maybe a rhubarb if you're feeling frisky.

Just got back from four days in Henderson / Vegas and I got a room here that was a comp, so I have no  clue how much it even costs, but here is the low-down. Its obviously a bargain type hotel/ casino. They do have a $1.00 breakfast to bring people in, and its marginal, but as soon as you walk in the doors of the hotel/casino, you instantly get that tobacco smell that seems to linger until you get in your non-smoking room, provided thats where you are. The run down elevators are a microcosm to what kind of place it is, but the rooms are clean and the air works so once inside, its a decent and roomy place. Surprising was the bed I had. Actually a comfortable mattress, so the decent black-out curtains allowed me to sleep in a bit. i can't comment on the gambling there since I don't gamble, but overall, my experience was decent. I advise you to stay away from the lunch buffet. Bland food, orange colored water they pass off as orange juice, and our waitress seemed like she couldn't wait to get home. Can you blame her? \n\nI've always thought, if you want to know how the food is, look around at the people eating it. After looking at the people eating it, I wanted to get the holy H out of there. Then again, that goes for most of the city anyway. I hate Vegas. I only went for a reunion of friends/family. Oh, did I mention it was 104 just about everyday? Ok, now I'm just bitching for the sake of bitching. \n\nMy favorite character was the woman that worked in the gift store. She had that 'been there, done that' look about her, and every time I walked by the place, the security guard was watching the counter and she was outside smoking. \n\nOverall, I would stay there again if I'm in a pinch.

This was not my first time to this location, but perhaps over a year since i have dined at Red Lobster. I just remember the amazing cheddar bay biscuits they bring freshly baked to the table. It was the best part of the meal here, always. I could eat the whole basket right when they bring it out and sometimes I do and then get too full to eat an entree.\n\nThe reason we chose Red Lobster for our early dinner was because there was an ad in the mail for $29.99 for 2 people to dine - 2 salads, 2 entrees, and choice of appetizer or desssert. As great as it sounded, I knew there would be a catch but we went anyways as I had been craving the biscuits. After waiting about 10 minutes to be seated, when it wasn't even busy... I was so disappointed with the deal. I knew the entees would be limited, but so were the desserts and appetizers, to only 3 choices of each. We also had a coupon with the ad that is $4 off two dinners, and the server said we could've used it with the $29.99 offer.\n\nBut I really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos. So that's what we ended up doing, lobster nachos and shrimp scampi to share. Pictures will be posted. The first 3 bites of each item was great! But that was about it. Then the nachos were soggy and there wasn't much lobster, and then the scampi was filled with small shrimps, but after about 3 bites I felt sick.\n\nThe server was very nice though. But I completely agree with the current rating of this restaurant, about 2.5 stars. Not worth the price for what you get. There's so many better quality or better value restaurants.\n\nI'll just have to learn to make the cheddar biscuits myself!

Served in a sourdough bowl.\" for $7.25 and the Nascar Burger, \"a classic Black Angus 10 oz juicy flame-broiled burger.\" for $9.25.\n\nFirst off, the spinach & artichoke dip were tasty, but too small of a portion for the price.

On the menu, it says, \"place in the center of the table and dive in!\"  Well, it's definitely not big enough to share.\n\nWe asked for the burger to be medium well, but it came out more well done.  There's a problem when you can't even get the burger right.  It had a decent flavor it in though, and it was also on a soft bun too.  The fries had a deep color that reminded me of Arby's curly fries, but without the seasoning.  \n\nService was a bit slow, not on our waitress's part, but on how long it took for the food to come out.

The atmosphere boasted an array of multi South East Asian designs combined with today's deco(r) of stressed stone, steel, woods, and hand crafted glass.\r\nCili seemed to spend a good deal of money on their floral arrangements, filling the restaurant with various orchids, and other exotic flowers and plants that give you the feel of being in the tropics. They also have a few paintings of images of Hawai'i. \r\nThe staff is great. The floor manager was quick to assess and respond to the last minute changes we had. The staff worked very hard and quickly to set up the place; making it beautiful and elegant. \r\nWhile the bridal party was out taking pre-wedding photos, Cili's floor manager had sent to the bridal room,(where the Event manager and myself were using as our staging area), h'ors devours ; of fresh fruit, vegetables and cheeses, some fusion sushi, and fresh salsa with house made tortilla chips and crackers. They were delicious. I almost couldn't't stop eating, but I had to remind myself about dinner. Along with this, they made sure we always had a full bottle of San Pellegrino flat and soda water, plus a bottle of Champagne. I had a massive hang-over from the festivities the previous night, so I failed to get the name on the bottle. They brought some beer, wine, sodas, and other alcohol beverages to the wedding party and the people involved with the behind-the-scenes operations of this event.\r\nAfter the wedding ceremony the guest were all escorted to a designated area, where they were served with cocktail and h'ors devours. This was out side of the restaurant, which was surrounded by a moat and the 9th and 18th hole of the course (I was earlier informed). I was able to witness the of the service staff here. They were professional, friendly and cordial. They were making it easy for everyone of the guest to enjoy the blissful event.\r\nThe entire course was designed as 18 single oasis's combined with paths to one another. The fees of the course start at about $375.00. This is a Pro-grade course.\r\nWhile everyone was being escorted to theirs seats by the event-staff, the servers were making sure every one had drinks. One of my favorite things at a wedding reception is the open-bar! What makes it even better is that some one else is bringing you your drink.\r\nThe dinner was a buffet set up. Which, I always find it a thousand times better than a prefixed plate. Not only can you taste many different things, but you can eat till you die.\r\n\r\nThe menu: Spring Mix Salad, various types of steamed and sauteed vegetables, house backed rolls w/ garlic herbed butter, baked and mashed potatoes, baked chicken, salmon in a herbed lemon cream sauce, and my favorite prime rib.\r\n(Now, I have been to 6 wedding in the last year and a half. The is the 2nd best meal I have since the first one in Hawai'i at Orchid's at the Halekulani Hotel.)\r\nSo when I say that this seemingly typical menu was far from typical, believe me. The chef and cooks of Cili have taken the common fare to the highest level. The vegetables were fresh and crisp, even the sauteed and steamed one. Nothing was over cooked or mushy. The roll as I have said were house made. The chicken and salmon were moist and delicious, the herbs and spices perfect. The prime rib; The BEST I have had in years!! I had to have another. I went back for a inch+ cut. Topped it with their delicious, spicy horse radish and hot full flavored ajous. Sadly though, my stomach ran out of room, and there was no more for a third cut.\r\nThe Cabernet that was being served at the table was great. Full flavored, full bodied, slightly spicy and dry. I could have sworn it was a Rhone. I didn't't get the name, but I did get a second glass. \r\nLater to be followed with Champagne, a Heineken, Fat Tire Amber, 2 shots of Patron, Corona, and more San Pellegrino. Don't worry!! hiccup, I'm fine!! Brup.\r\nThe cake looked wonderful and delicious. I couldn't't summon the will to eat another bite of food. \r\nTea and coffee was served to the guest. What ever type of coffee it was, it near perfect. Not too heavy or too light. It really hot the spot after all that food. Which made way for the tequila and beer.\r\nI was  coherent enough to recognize the great service that everyone received, and to notice as we were preparing to leave, the quick smooth disassembly reset-up of the restaurant. \"These guys are real pros\", I thought to myself.", "business_id": "xUnM3aQI3BIw_zNU8cBgEA", "second": 1, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2006-11-05", "length": 854, "open": 1}

When it first opened everyone was amazed at how \"real\" the plants and animals look.  Now - they look dusty.  Very, very dusty.  Now I'm guessing it would take even more that a massive dusting to bring back the days of 2 hour long waits and lines to get in the doors (Yes, it was like that for a LONG time) but it sure would help.  \n\nI have a friend who loves the food, so I've only been there with a child once (sad I know).  Every other time it's been with all adults.  Yea, it's Disneyland cheesy, but it's also kinda Disneyland cool.  You have to appreciate the work behind some of this stuff.  And remember - it's a theme restaurant. It's supposed to keep it's theme front and center.  And yea, it can get a little loud.  Especially if the gorilla starts going off on one of his long rants as you're trying to order.  But I've never really had a problem with it in hearing the group or giving our order.  \n\nMy favorite part honestly is the archway between the restaurant and the gift shop.  It is a giant fish tank.  No animatronic fish here.   Real fish.  And it's pretty freaking cool.  But the star it might gain from that it immediately loses for the prices.  Just like many theme restaurants, they are overcharging you for the food.  Of course they have to cover the costs of maintaining that fish tank and all those animatronic animals.  So while I kinda get it, it's still too much for a regular dinner.  \n\nTheir gift store is almost another review in itself.  Again, a bit overpriced, but they honestly do have some really cute stuff.  I've gotten a few small things here as gifts over the years for kids who are in that \"I love animals\" phase of life.  Always a hit.  \n\nWhen your aunt and uncle with kids come into town and want to go somewhere different that the kids will like - You'll get big bonus points for bringing them here.  Other than that, it has a fairly limited audience.  And dear heavens, don't bring anyone who is an OCD cleaner.

You could probably even finish your overpriced meal and knock back a drink or two before the critters started actiing up.  You could even purchase a toy at the gift shop on the way in and hope to finish a dessert.  This will only cost you an arm and a leg, standard amusement park pricing.\n\nIf you're just 2 ladeez trying to catch up, this is probably not your venue.  There are kids and families all around -- happily, their ruckus won't be too annoying because all you can hear are jungle sounds and thunderstorms.  For a \"save the animals\" themed place, there sure was a lot of meat on the menu.  The only veggie options were cheez sticks or a veggie burger.  I guess I could've gotten the shrimp pasta sans shrimp, but I balked at the $17 price tag.\n\nI did like sitting next to the enormous fish tank and having them peer at the progress of my dinner.

Now I must admit that Evian water is probably the best tasting water I've ever had, but in no way am I ever paying so much for water.\n\nThe food made up for the debacle.  I had the veal, which was just right and the portion was huge.  My sister had the chicken pasta which was also great.  The noodles were just right.  \n\nDuring our meal, one of the employees went around the restaurant and serenaded us.

Hey, did you know that they sing here?  They do!  It's like Max's Opera Cafe but called something else with different food.  That was an interesting and unexpected touch.  Our waitress didn't sing though, so I dunno if they all do, or just some.\nThe service was lukewarm but fairly efficient (we only had to ask for water once).  I started off with the bruschetta which was much sweeter than any other bruschetta I've had (clearly from the balsamico they used) and the bread was harder than diamonds.  I had to send it through a wood chipper before I could manage to bite down on it.  The bread they serve at the table is soft and delish though, so if you're thinking you want to kick your meal off with bread, I might just stick with that.\nFrom there I moved on to the goat cheese and spinach ravioli.  Served in a yummy, tangy pink sauce, I don't know how they get away with putting spinach in the name of the dish.  It was goat cheese ravioli (I wonder if they were house made, or just under cooked - they were incredibly firm on the edges), with a few wilty pieces of spinach on top in the sauce.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but this dish was too. . . . \n??  Salty?  Intense?  Rich?  I'm not sure.  But I could only eat half, and where goat cheese is concerned that is totally unlike me.\nThe mamacita's minestrone also featured undercooked beans, which meant she only ate half of her meal as well.\nThe good news is, this leaves room for dessert!  I ordered the creme brulee and was sufficiently underwhelmed.  Now I remember why I never really liked the stuff.\nA wholehearted meh.

It's a little  confusing to see Hawaiian names and foods next to Caribbean names and foods, but as Chris Rock would say - it's all right cause it's all white!  The quality of food is so-so, nothing to write home to ma.  Location is prime...I think TI is one of the better hotels destinations on the strip - huge parking garage, convenient location (near the highway on ramp), close to the gigantic mall, nice theme, good club (Tangerine)...but I digress.\n\nSo Kahunaville will try it's damnedest to entertain the crap out of you while you eat.  In a less than intrusive way, which I appreciated.  We ordered a couple of the sample appetizer plates which came with a fake volcano and deco pieces.  Every 45 minutes or so, they would dim the lights for the water show I'll call Baby Bellagio.  There's girls walking around in coconut bras, asking people if they want to get \"lei'd\" for $20...which is the cheapest lay on the Strip.  And of course, the professional bartender show, which gets everyone in a Spring-Break woo-hoo frame of mind.

When you want to get down and dirty with the quarter slots, a weathered cocktail waitress in a tawdry cowgirl outfit under the video'd canopy of Fremont Street, then belly up to the five dollar buffet at three in the morning to wash it all down with a top sirloin, downtown Vegas is the place to be.\r\n\r\nEssentially established in 1905 as the City's main thoroughfare, Fremont Street was Las Vegas' first paved street.  The area drew a few wealthy entrepreneurs seeking to capitalize on the cross-country migrations of GI's.  Those entrepreneurs became the great casino magnates, and together with key Hollywood celebrities, built an empire around the Northern Club, Horseshoe, Golden Nugget, Golden Gate, Apache and Fremont hotels, the original resorts of Glitter Gulch.\r\n\r\nStarting in 1941 with the El Rancho, and then with the emergence of the large Strip resorts and the famed \"Rat Pack\" in the fifties, the downtown area began to fall slowly into disrepair and decline.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, the entire downtown area received a desperately needed facelift in the form of the \"Fremont Street Experience\" during which five street blocks, between Main and South Las Vegas Boulevard, were fitted with a mammoth LED video canopy, the street was closed to vehicles and converted into a pedestrian promenade, and the landscape completely overhauled in a proud celebration of downtown's neon gaming heritage.\r\n\r\nToday, Fremont Street is an amazing, if not shocking, juxtaposition of cultures.  This way of life won't be found on the Strip or anywhere else in Las Vegas; millions of blinding lights provide a veneer of polished entertainment, thinly veiling a crude scene tucked away in the darkness just beyond the canopy of lights in the odd dark alley or corner, as the real Fremont Street \"experience\" unfolds in a vast spectacle starring the lowest ilk of the City.  This is where the City's street denizens - prostitutes, muggers, hobos, drug dealers, addicts, rapists, thieves, other unsavories, and the simply homeless - execute their nightly rituals of survival.

As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.

Flights are late, TSA carry-on rules are a pain and some overworked and underpaid airline employees make no secret of their unhappiness. But none of that makes it less amazing that for a historically small amount of money you can be whisked to any location in the country (the world, for that matter), reliably, in complete safety (as of 9-29-07 US commercial aviation is batting one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures) and at least relative comfort. \n\nThere are a number of problems with bitching, but the biggest is that it leads to blindness. We overlook or dismiss lots of good things, big and small. Jose Cuervo Taquileria at McCarran Airport (Concourse C) in Las Vegas probably gets overlooked and dismissed a lot. And I think that's a shame. I've been there twice, and was impressed both times, though in very different ways\n\nFirst time I was making a connection (something in common between an airport and Yelp?), the place was full but my friend and I scored a table. The first thing the waitress said to us: 'kitchen is backed up. It could be 45 minutes to get your orders out. Is that OK?' It wasn't (couldn't wait), so we left. But I was impressed. That was someone who had her thinking cap on, was willing to be honest and by so doing saved everyone a lot of grief and aggravation.\n\nMy second experience was more conventional, but equally customer-centric. For around $13 plus tip I got a generous sized and good (on a par with what I'd expect walking into a random San Francisco Tequileria) chicken  fajita burrito plate and large bottle of ice tea served by the the very friendly and efficient  Rachel. Chips and rice were fresh, beans were good, the fajita itself was well prepared. When I asked for Nutrasweet Rachel ran to Starbucks to acquire some. \n\nBut more than the food, the tea, the Nutrasweet, the service,  I  got a small island of comfort and private space. The experience didn't change my life, but it made the trip more pleasant, and was well worth the price. I'll be back. \n\nFood: Three Stars\nService: Five Stars\nTotal Experience: Four Stars\nOther problem with bitching: it's bad for you.

I have never been to the Bass Pro Shop, but have heard that they have a good restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was large - I didn't even make it into the store. I didn't feel like I was in Key West, despite the Jimmy Buffet music playing. I felt like a Red Lobster exploded. It was much larger than Red Lobster, but the d\u00e9cor was similar. One key feature was the large aquarium behind the bar. Fish were circling on the ceiling and there were photos of fish people had caught on the walls. \n\nThe menu had a large selection to choose from. I ended up choosing the Pan Fried Trout with potatoes, corn and a corn muffin ($11.99). The first item to arrive was a mini-loaf of bread. The bread was good, but it had a bit of honey glazed across it, which made it sticky. I liked the bread, but wasn't impressed with the sticky sensation. Next thing to arrive was the trout. It came on a cast iron skillet and I felt if I were a kid, went fishing with my grandfather and fried up the day's haul...except I never did those things and there were no heads and cleaning wasn't required. BUT if I had caught fish with my grandfather and cooked it on a cast iron skillet over a camp fire, this might be what it would taste like. All the fun of fishing and camping, but without the nasty parts. The trout arrived with a lemon and a sprig of rosemary. The thickly cut potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and quite tasty. The corn, not so much. It was grilled, but tasted like a twice-grilled unflavored Niblet that stuck to your teeth. Save some for later I suppose.  The corn muffin was dry, corn-mealy and kind of tasteless. I ordered dessert - the apple pie - and it was cast iron galore again. A scoop of ice cream with the pie and it was a nice end to a tasty meal. \n\nThe restaurant wasn't busy, despite it being lunchtime on the 4th of July. Even the bathrooms were nice - big and clean. The only downside was when I walked in to wash the sticky honey off of my hands and a guy was sitting in the stall holding a conversation on his cell phone. \n\nI would definitely try this place again.

Main dishes for our little crew consisted of enchiladas, soft tacos and seviche.  All filling our desire for a bit of South of the Border fare.\n\nThe dessert, like we needed it, was a perfectly chilled flan.  The bottom/top was just soaked with the wonderful almost burnt sugar...Loved it!\n\nI really liked the staff....they were attentive and made us feel oh so welcome.

My friend and I were visiting Montreal and I mentioned the last time I ate at this restaurant was 12 years ago and it was totally awesome. We decided to have dinner one night and boy did things change. \n\nI must say I have never been so insulted. First, I speak Spanish fluently but I decided to speak English. The hostess, did not host, no one greeted us at the door- let's be clear Montreal closes early and when one decides to go to dinner at 9:30pm at night on a Saturday, it seems restaurants are not pleased. \n\nSecond, one of the Mariachi band members (the old, short one with long hair) was down right insulting and racist. He made fun of us the moment we entered the restaurant because we spoke English, then because we are Asian and decided to mock us by singing a song about an Asian girl and trying to saying Hi in any Asian language and laughed! They sang even when we told them we did not want to be serenaded. \n\nThe food was fine but I found a hair in the salsa. The general service was quick and efficient. Our waiter was friendly and nice. However, the distasteful Mariachi had made me lose my appetite. I will never go to this restaurant again especially if management/owner continues to hire singers that taint the restaurant in this manner. \n\nComing from NYC where Mexican food is found at every street corner, from budget to upscale.

So yeah, we're all dolled up.  Thursdays was definitely the WRONG place to stop first.  We intended to hit the club there,  but unfortunately we arrived too early (it was like 9:30pm...) so we just opted for the plain old bar area.  We were certainly the black sheep.  \n\nIt seemed like everyone at the bar was staring at us as we ordered.  They serve no martinis, no long islands.  Luckily I enjoy beer so I just ordered a bottle of Molson and got a shot of SoCo.  It was quite expensive, especially considering the exchange rate now makes the Canadian Dollar worth more than the American Dollar - sheesh.  After a few minutes of some of the pickier ladies trying to figure out what they could drink, I watched the bar-back rummaging around in the lower cabinets behind the bar.  He successfully found a bottle of Apple Martini Mix.  So Apple Martinis it was.  And we left after that.  I could tell the locals already hated us.  \n\nThe greatest part about this place was the breathalyzer test on the wall.  I wonder who really uses it and doesn't just abuse it?  I guess it's a smart thing to have in a bar, but had we made this a later stop in our search for libations, I'm sure we would have enjoyed playing the \"who's more drunk\" game!", "business_id": "5wtxyOJCYHE5Dhnmxcyoeg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2009-01-06", "length": 252, "open": 0}

Unfortunately, we had completely forgotten that it was Valentine's Day and the place was packed. \n\nI can not imagine why. \n\nThe host assured us that we would be seated within 10-15 minutes. I guess that was 10-15 minutes Montreal time, but in Boston time it was about 25. Whatever, they were nice enough about it and 25 minutes isn't too bad when there is a bar to sit at and drinks to be had. \n\nAfter 25 minutes, we snaked our way through the restaurant which started to resemble a casting for \"Real Housewives of Orange County\". After sitting down, I took a look around and realized this was middle-aged, MILF-wannabe heaven. These women looked more fried than the calamari and the men more pruny than the pickles served de gratis at every table.\n\nOrdering was very painless. The waiter was careful to take the ladies' orders first. The service was neither stellar nor poor. We were clearly a number that night, but it would have been nice to have faster service when it came to drinks. The waiter would pass by the table quick enough to get one drink order in, instead of asking us all at once. Oh well. \n\nThe food itself was not very appealing. I ordered the shrimp in garlic butter and was pleased with the quantity of shrimp, but the meal itself was not very tasty. The garlic butter seemed to be just butter and the rice it was served with had no flavor. I don't think it was worth the 20-something dollars I paid for it. \n\nLooking around the table it seemed as if most of my group felt the same. Most plates were unfinished.

A great deal of the objects, surfaces and seating within the lounge are not made of ice.  You also advertise the lounge as being filled with candles.

They make you wear some arctic  clothing to keep you warm. (and keep the ice clean too I think)\n\nThe hostess told me they axed the 30 minute time limit in Vegas..because it's vegas baby!

The admission includes 1 drink, and since drinks tend to cost about $12-$15 you're really only paying about $15.  If you can find a coupon it's a screaming deal, especially in the summer where air this cold will only be found here!\n\nThey don't allow photography, but they will take your picture for a fee.. now I saw people take pictures against the rules with no wrist slapping when the staff weren't looking.  \n\nWhen I was here on a Saturday night over new year's weekend the place wasn't too busy and there was no wait to get in..

It wasn't.  My t-bone steak, ordered medium rare, came out closer to done, and each bite into it reaffirmed that suspicion.  The steak fries (our options for lunch being fries or veggies) were... sigh... disappointing.  I'm a huge potato fanatic, and it's not as though I think potatoes need to be cooked in any special way.  In fact, I think that potatoes seem to almost cook themselves, they're that delicious to me.  But, when you take the least imaginative cook in the world, give him a vat of oil and potatoes, you would have gotten the steak fries we did.  They had no seasoning!  None at all!  I don't know how no one noticed, how it simply escaped the taste buds of every cook in the back, but... just... but.... \n\nAs a sidenote, it's very disconcerting to be served in a saloon by a Lebanese guy trying hard at a western accent.  \n\nBut ok, there were definitely pros, or maybe just one \"pro\".

The Mermaid Lounge is found in the Silverton Casino, just a little south of the main strip, and lives up to its name in a surprising way.\n\nThere is a beautiful aquarium just outside the restaurant, with plenty of fish, manta rays, and... an actual swimming, smiling mermaid.\n\nWhile it's not a modern discovery of science, the fully underwater girl dressed as a mermaid swims up to you, poses for pictures (between the tank glass), and admittedly, it's a very novel and cool effect.  The girl's a good sport, making sure that camera hungry folk get a good shot or two before popping her breathing apparatus back in.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite pretty, with chairs named after famous fish folk (Ariel, Shamu, etc), and behind the bar is a tank of jellyfish that have neon lights flickering around them, making their translucent bodies change color.  Beautiful and creepy all at once.\n\nThe first server girl we ran into was a little stand-offish, but our main server was very friendly and attentive.  Food and drinks here are reasonably cheap (less than $10 for most meals, and the same for drinks).  I tried the ahi tuna wrap, and it was quite tasty (and a little spicy).\n\nThe Silverton is a little out of the way from the Strip, but this is a very cool bar, and worth the extra effort to get over there.  The aquarium is awesome, and there is a small alcove that when walking in, gives you a brief sensation that you are actually walking into the aquarium's water.  It's an interesting effect in itself.\n\nSeriously, though.

There is nothing remotely manly about this place.  You are not Serendipity's target demographic.  There's not much of a bar and you won't find Sportscenter on any TV.  You are at Serendipity because your wife/girlfriend/girl-you-want-to-impress dragged you out here.  Just resign yourself to the fact that you will be dining in a big, pink restaurant and you may actually enjoy yourself.  That being said, the food is actually quite good, if you can get over the cutesy dish names (Spinny Dip vs. Spinach Dip).\n\nAside from the menu, you'll find very few similarities between Serendipity Las Vegas and Serendipity New York.  The NY location is small little cozy restaurant tucked away on a side street in the middle of a big city.  It's been made famous by the John Cusack movie of the same name and guest appearances on Sex and the City. The Las Vegas location is smack dab in the middle of the brightest, tackiest, loudest spot on the Las Vegas strip.  When I say it's on the Las Vegas Strip, it's literally on the strip.  If you spill your drink while dining on one of the patio tables, you'll most likely hit a tourist walking by.  The Vegas location is large and open.  It loses a lot of the intimate atmosphere of the original Serendipity.\n\nThe food is surprisingly good.  It's typical American food, except with a cute, girly name and a not-so-cute price tag.  You've got a large selection of sandwiches and burgers, and a smaller selection of pizzas, pastas, and salads.  But you're not here for the entrees.  You're here for the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Well, maybe not you, but your female dining companion certainly is.  It's chocolate, it's sweet, it's cute, and it's really expensive.  It's what every girl loves, wrapped up in a delicious calorie-laden dessert.\n\nI'm going to reserve judgement on their service as they just opened up a few days ago.  We made reservations the day before we arrived but when we got there, we were told that the reservation system doesn't work and they don't get any updates.  We had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our seat.  We requested an indoor table but got a patio table instead.  Weather was mild but just a tad chilly so the restaurant had some gas-powered heaters going.  Unfortunately, the heaters were brand-spanking new and created a noxious odor that burned your nostrils and made your eyes water.  We requested that the burner next to us be turned off, but there was nothing we could do about the burners upwind from us.  The table there liked the heat.  There were two parties that sat next to us who left because they couldn't stand the fumes emanating from the heaters.  We were starving so we sat through the smell.\n\nPros: Great location on the strip - excellent view.  Wide variety of food.

My server says a big grand opening event will happen in October and Chris Cornell will perform.  More on that later.\n\nThis has to be the biggest and most detailed Hard Rock anywhere.  According to the staff it's been in the works for four years and it shows.  It's prime location on the strip is just the start.  Once you walk in you'll get a number that directs you to the second or third level dining areas.  I got level 3 which features a huge split level dining hall, full size bar and a small intimate stage for live acts at the back of the room. (see Chris Cornell above). The number of mouths this place can feed at a time is huge at more than 800 seats.  Just imagine the kitchen on a busy night!\n\nThe food is the same menu at any Hard Rock.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was a lot better than expected, especially the bacon.  Pricing at 13 bucks is a little high but you are on the strip and at the best HRC ever built.  It would be nice if the drink menu included pricing.  It was relatively slow when I was there.  And since all the staff is new they are eager to please and clearly instructed to go for the upsell.\n\nAfter the meal you can just roam around and that's where it gets really fun.  The path to the third floor restroom is lined with infamous and at times chilling news headlines of the deaths of Lennon, Elvis and both Kennedys.  On a lighter note, a special room is dedicated to wedding memorabilia.  Elvis and Priscilla, John and Yoko, Ike and Tina and my heart skipped a beat when I came across a signed acoustic from Kurt Cobain at the Kurt and Courtney section.  Another awesome moment was a drum set from White Zombie mounted on the wall as you go down the stairs.\n\nAnother thing that makes this place unique is all the interactive technology.  Lots of Microsoft Surface tables and a huge touchscreen wall where you can check out everything that's on site.\n\nIf this doesn't become the flagship HRC soon I will be shocked.

If you are looking for something a little bit more private or intimate, this is not the location for you. \n\nAs Sin City is not available in my area, I was looking forward to trying some of their brews. The three I tried was the seasonal Imperial Czech Pilsner, the Weisse and the Stout. \n\nThe Imperial Czech Pilsner was not enjoyable, and I love pilsners. It had a scent of wheat and malts with a hint of hops like a pils should. Unlike most pils, it was very hoppy. The flavor was mostly of floral hops and it had a perfume like taste to it. The finish was very bitter and lingered on the tongue. \n\nThe Weisse was okay. It had a good Banana and clove scent that carried over into the flavor where it was enhanced with a cereal malt accent. There was a mild hoppy finish to it. Overall it wasn't a great Weisse, but it was better than okay. \n\nThe Stout was pretty good. You could easily pick up the strong scent of coffee malts complimented with a hint of mocha. The flavor was mostly the roasted coffee malts and a touch of floral hops. There was a touch of chocolate malt to it, but it almost tasted like an extract that was added. They do their own version of the Irish Car bomb with this stout that is pretty good.\n\nOverall the beer was okay, I really can't comment on the others as that after three beers my taste buds are fried and my pallet has a hard time discerning between the different flavors. Honestly, I would not go out of my way for the beer, but if I was in the neighborhood, yea I'd grab one as they are still better than the mass produced beers you find out there. \n\nThe reason I gave this place 4 stars is because of the service. Mandy was absolutely fantastic in her knowledge of the beers and the different styles. I heard her explain what a weisse was to multiple customers as they came up. She took good care of my wife and me and even made a special drink for us after the beers she called the Mandilicious that was good... even if it contained no beer at all.", "business_id": "c6EpEvtu-h4NbCGt4Q-S8g", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2011-07-25", "length": 516, "open": 0}

Yes, there was a 31 foot Stripper which IS the entrance of the bar/lounge. \nI met up with one of my fiends that lived in Vegas while I was in town. When we walked in, we were greeted my a very nice lady. When I was on my way to meet my friend I noticed a sign in the middle of the mall that said buy-1-get-1 at the Stripper Bar, so I mentioned this to the waitress when we arrived and she had to ask someone else to verify. We were able to get the special, and if anyone wants to know the Amstel Light is $6.00 per bottle. We had one beer there and we paid for another to go. Once we met up with my wife and brother who was in the casino, we convinced them to go back. That is when the fun started. We had 4 people in our party and so when we got back we had the same waitress as before, well considering there was only 2 people working. We decided to sit around the \"center stage\". We were there for like 20-30min just drinking and I noticed that no one was getting on the stage and dancing. I asked and the reason might seem shocking for a place called the Stripper Bar. There is a Theater right next door and there was TONS of people waiting in line. There were a bunch of families with kids as well. She said they normally wait until all the kids are in the theater before they dance. It is nice they think about others. That didn't stop other families strolling by in the mall, to take pictures. Some dads even had their kids pose under the legs of the huge stripper to take photos. That's was part of the fun. I would say we were there for about another 2 hours and we all had fun. The girls that worked there were very nice and if the place is still there when we come back we will make a point to stop by again. \nAnother quick tip - if you do look up under the large stripper's skirt you will notice that you can see lips and while we were there the manager had a ladder under her and they ended up coloring panties on her. I guess they are going to add a camera under the skirt so when people pass through and look up they will get a picture taken and they can buy it as a souvenir.", "business_id": "uP3tzmY1_79EP7YO6UPkyQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2010-04-12", "length": 446, "open": 0}

The store itself isn't huge, so I can imagine it getting a little crowded in there, but it's stuffed with every type of candy you could ever want! On my recent visit I was greeted at the door by a smiley, happy employee named Lindsay. She asked what brought me to Sugar Factory and if there was anything she could help me with. I was there for a couture pop for my sister-in-law's bridal shower so she led me to the back of the store and introduced me to the wall of couture pops. She explained the different celebrity and signature handles and the differences in the refill flavors. We found the perfect combination of handle and lollipop flavor for my sister-in-law, I know she'll love it! $25, but it's a special event so i'll let it slide. My husband bought one for me while we were in there, even if he secretly thought it was a bit ridiculous. Best husband ever! I got the pina colada flavored lollipop and the Silver Rainbow (Kim Kardashian) handle. The lollipop was so yummy and lasted me a few weeks! Thankfully they come with plastic snap covers!\n\nLindsay gave us a short tour around the store (short b/c as I said the store isn't huge) and answered some questions we had about a few products. She even gave us some samples. =) She held onto all of my purchases and asked us where we were from. Found out later she went to college in my homestate, she was the 3rd person we met that trip in Vegas that was from OK lol. \n\nAnyway, getting off topic. Lots of dispensers in the middle of the room eagerly waiting for you to put a bag or a bucket under it's spout. They sell t-shirts but none of them are physically larger than an adult small, and that's the adult sizes. Lindsay was wearing a shirt marked XL and she was very tiny - sorry normal size people, no shirts for us. =(  Several yummy non-clothing items line the walls: rice krispie treats in the shape of a cupcake topped with chocolate (I bought 2), little cookies in different shapes, chocolate bunnies, larger-than-your-face old fashioned lollipops, adult candy necklace items, cupcakes, fudge, chocolate bars, unicorn pops, shot glasses (bought this too), drinks, you name it! I didn't get to sample their gelato or crepes but I hear they are delicious. \n\nMade it out of the store a little poorer, but it was worth it. Brought my mother-in-law back a few hours later and Lindsay was still working so she helped my mother-in-law out.

Brainless, hot waitresses in scanty nurse get ups, food that is frighteningly high in fat and calories, marginal 80's music videos playing, customers wearing hospital smocks, shakes with butter on top, fat bastards getting free meals. Sounds like a cheese ball train wreck to me. But alas, I was talked into going here last night and have to say my prejudgment was wrong. \n\nLet's start with the waitresses. As a Vegas resident, hot waitresses are all over the place, and do not entice me to eat somewhere. Don't get me wrong I love checking out hotness as much as the next guy. I just think it's usually kind of a cheap gimmick to get business. The gals here though are quite personable and some are pretty funny on how they present the whole concept of the unhealthiness of this place. They celebrate what they offer, with humor. So it does not come off as tacky sluts serving food...it comes off more smart, cute and personable. Service was fast and we were asked 2-3 times if we needed anything. They text their orders in too which is kind of cool.\n\nThe food. Man, some of this stuff sounds pretty disgusting. The onions are saut\u00e9ed in pig lard. The fries are fresh cut and fried in lard. Both are full of rich flavor. If you demand crisp fries, it ain't happening here....but they are delish. The buns are fresh and come from a local bakery. The meat is 19% fat and comes from locally owned Larry's Meat Market. I like the fact that they incorporate local businesses in their business model. I had a chance to speak with the owner, Dr. John, that's where I'm getting this info, the guy is a marketing genius IMO. The burgers are certainly better than most places too.\n\nI like malts and shakes...usually a nice chocolate malt over a shake. We were served a sample of the chocolate shake (sans the pat of butter on top) and I have to say it was one of the best chocolate shakes I have EVER had...seriously. Rich and VERY chocolately.\n\nWhat I thought would be silly, tourist trap, douche city turned out to be a fun, delicious surprise.

We were looking for a reprieve from The Strip, which was being pummeled by a dust storm, so we thought Paris seemed like a place we could find a good lounge. \n\nAfter walking in circles having trouble finding anything but a quickie casino bar, we saw Le Central, a slightly-elevated circular bar that looked like a decent vantage point for playing \"That's Your Boyfriend\". (Oh and it WAS.)\n\nThe server, whose name I've forgotten, was totally sweet and reminded me a lot of Bethenny Frankel. Funny, a little dry and caustic, but inviting and welcoming.\n\nMartini drinks were 2 for 1, and I appreciated that she didn't make each of us get two. She let us pay for 1 and each have our own individual.  Some bars here make you drink them both *and* sometimes even force you to get them both at the same time, leaving one warm and less than awesome. So that was nice.\n\nSadly, the drinks recommended -- the French Bikini made with chambord and pineapple and Absolut, was kind of bleh.  It's not my usual kind of drink to order, but my friend didn't really get into it either, so I don't think it was just me. We drank it -- don't get me wrong. For $16, you drink your damn drink, but we promptly headed over to The Cosmopolitan for a proper cocktail like we should've from the get-go.  (But That's Your Boyfriend isn't as tragic there.)\n\nIf I happened to be in Paris and just needed a cocktail, I'd cop a squat and get a drink here, sure.

Our buddy had his bachelor party in Vegas, and what better way to cap it off than an entire day of football and hot 5 way action (parlays, that is).  In a town that caters to everyone's vices, it's hard to believe that Vegas lacked an upscale sports bar with food and in-house sports book.  Thankfully, The Ainsworth has transplanted their successful sports bar in NYC to the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas.  Just be sure you make reservations for your group ahead of time.  We had reservations for 10AM and stayed until the last game, as did a majority of the other tables.  Also, the table must run a $50/person minimum tab (food and drinks), but if you're staying for the morning and afternoon games, this won't be an issue.  \n\nThe food menu consists of your standard bar food:  wings, fries, burgers, and an assortment of sliders - all ranging from $10 to $17.  Beers were around $7 and cocktails ranged from $11-$15.  \n\nI took off one star because of the space's design.  I'm gonna try and paint a mental image here, so hopefully this will help you picture the space in your mind.  I've also added some photos to help.  The wall above the bar houses one large flat-screen flanked on both sides by 4 smaller flat screens.  The perimeter wall directly opposite the bar is lined with 5 tables and 5 smaller flat-screens.  In between the bar and the perimeter wall is empty space for the standing room crowd.  Most sports bars elevate the tables and chairs along the perimeter walls on a raised surface.  They do this so your view isn't obstructed by people standing between you and the TVs.  The tables at Ainsworth are at ground level, so you maybe jockeying for viewing position with folks standing by the bar.  The photos were taken before the game started - so people were just starting to enter.  The crowd was only an issue for the first couple hours as the standing room crowd started to dwindle as the games progressed.  Luckily, the manager will be more than happy to put on whatever game you want on the TV directly above your table, in case your view is obstructed.  Otherwise, it's an easy fix if they decide to make a design change.", "business_id": "3UsoXpGO0Enox-WgGzt8Tw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2012-09-12", "length": 418, "open": 0}

I frequent this 'venue' even though I have never ordered drinks (and never will) nor a bite to eat (do they even serve food here?).\n\nI come here for Picture Pilot. \n\nOr what was once Picture Pilot.  \n\nPicture Pilot!\n\nA History\nBack in 2009, there were three \"bands\" worth listening to in Las Vegas: A Crowd of Small Adventures, Imagine Dragons, and Picture Pilot. For the latter two, I would skip other bigger touring artists' concerts to instead attend their local shows because I felt they would someday make it big.\n\nHaving been mentored, by other more experienced followers of tours (or tourers, like some are called), to pick some local artists that played a lot of cheap, local shows, and, go to a shitton of them, I did just that. I tried to go to all of them. \n\nAnd that was supposed to be the way to reach the century mark for multiple major artists, cheap and easy. Century mark being a nerdtastic (and possibly unhealthy) one hundred live shows attended for a particular artist. (Why would anyone want to go to 100 concerts of one artist is beyond me?)\n\nImagine Dragons reconfigured their group and moved to fucking Los Angeles to work with producer Alex Da' Kid. Worse: Picture Pilot broke up and stopped doing shows entirely. Worst: A Crowd of Small Adventures stuck around, but never played many shows, and did not really break out of the tiny venue, sparsely attended gigs. (They may have been booked for Life Is Beautiful; I am not sure.)\n\nZebra Lounge\nIn any case, that is one long ass prologue to state that Tony Venniro, former lead vocals and lead guitarist of Picture Pilot, is here at the motherfucking Zebra Lounge in The Palazzo\u00ae, playing to bourgeoisie tourists sipping dumb-looking cocktails and conversing about stupid shit other than music. They do not notice the beauty of the art being performed live right in front of them. They cannot appreciate the venerable talent -- birthed from ten thousand plus hours of purposeful practice -- emanating from the fantastic fingers of Venniro. \n\nPicture Pilot: How much I have looked and looked around town to hear you again live. \n\nPicture Pilot: You may be out there, on the road, touring with a different front man and lead guitarist, but PP, to me, will always be Venniro, and, here he is playing at the motherfucking Zebra Lounge. Free-of-charge and non-ticketed to anyone who gives enough of a damn to come by to listen. \n\nNeedless to say, I am a fan. - E", "business_id": "-YeplFvQK1HexxL9D0wCpw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-12-01", "length": 449, "open": 0}

Let me explain.\n\nBefore you just came up to the ticket booth, tell them what show you wanted tickets for, pay for them, and then you were on your merry way. Now when you tell them what you want, there is a monitor right in front of you where you get asked at least 3 separate times if you want to upgrade your ticket, purchase a souvenir drink, or pick another Planet Hollywood show for 50 percent off. I guess these guys gotta try to make money any which way they can but this new way they are doing it makes your wait in line even longer.\n\nSo I get in line at 8:20. My show starts at 9. By the time I get my tickets and make my way up to the theater, it is almost 9. Now imagine if I got in line at quarter til. That would of been a fail.\n\nOk so now on to the show. For those that have seen Sin City Comedy (which is now in their own theater inside the casino on the second floor), The Awesome 80's Show, and The Mentalist, the Las Vegas Live Comedy Club is in the same exact venue. \n\nJust like other comedy shows, you have different comedians every week. The stage has more than enough room even for the biggest comedian. As for the seating, I would say you can fit up to about 80 people.\n\nThere is no bar in there but you can order drinks from the servers that come around. Just don't forget to tip them.\n\nOverall I had a decent time laughing at the various comics that took their turns. I would say a return trip would be ok.

Now, with that being said:\n\nLines of sight are absolute shit at Encore Theater. Sound is fine.\n\nI wanted to get that out of the way. (Moving on ...)\n\nThis venue is where Garth Brooks performs (Lorde, is he awful) and where (Spoilers) Jon Secada may be preparing a run at a Las Vegas residency.

No mention of this anywhere in the 500$ or so ticket. Warning: Seats may have shit line of sight. Let me be clear: I do not mean parts of the stage. I do not mean the extreme corners of the stage. I mean front and centre, right where Garth sets up to talk his nonsense for an hour. The view of that is obstructed. Great venue (sarcasm). \n\nIn the orchestra section, if one is seated to the extreme sides, the corresponding side of the stage will be missed. Not really unexpected, but for the caliber of theatre this is supposed to be, and the ticket price, one would think that a concert venue inside the building named after a man who reportedly is so involved with everything being built to perfection and exact specifications, would have been designed more thoughtfully. \n\nIn sum -- Encore Theater could have been built better. \"Meh.

Our table for four wasn't quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.\n\nOnce seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn't help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.\n\nThe menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn't enough meat to it.\n\nThe sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.\n\nDessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would've been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn't care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship.

That's interesting. \n\nThe cocktail waitresses were very friendly and attentive, not to mention they were all eye candies too. I was surprised to see them wearing open toe shoes without stockings, never seen anything like that in Vegas, I guess SLS wanted to make everything edgy, hip and different. \n\nI would say this lounge was better for me on slow nights, the drinks were yummy, a bit pricey, $15-18, but it was to be expected, just don't charge different prices on the same drink, that was odd!", "business_id": "K48K9_N2EOlk1nCLhXxlUg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2014-11-19", "length": 385, "open": 1}

I know they'd had three nights to practice on the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me fortunate enough to attend one of the \"soft openings\", but they said that it was different now that it's \"real\". :)\n\nAlso ridiculously, I can boast that I was the first customer to order the Lago cocktail, the one with the edible flower suspended in an ice sphere and sprinkled with glitter.

We did mention it to the server.\n\n~Some (ok, maybe most) will find the portions skimpy. Prices are what you can expect - similar to places like Jaleo, Giada, Rose. Rabbit. Lie., etc. You know, the ubiquitous small-plates joints.\n\n~Just to make it easy on the bartenders, if the spirit is on the menu, there should be a bottle of it at the bar...I still feel badly that someone had to run out for the Nolet's. \n\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience!

So far the best she can do is small sips of Gatorade.  She ordered a pasta dish, I think it was one of the house specials.  I'm pretty sure one of the listed ingredients might have been egg yolk.  Looking back now, that seems odd - why list egg yolk unless it is raw - in which case - what the heck?  She thinks she remembers seeing that too but, at the time, not giving it much thought. \n\nThe location is amazing (right across from the Bellagio fountain).  As far as my dinner - it was okay.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip - which is one of the best I've ever had.  For my main course I had the fillet which was cooked exactly as I ordered (medium), but a bit dry and lacking any flavor other than when the pepper it was dusted with before cooking happened to touch my tongue.  There was a very small dollop of 'steak sauce' on the plate, I suppose it's there incase the pepper didn't work.  I tasted the sauce - nothing to rave about and I'd prefer something better than homemade A-1.\n\nThis space used to be occupied by the Sugar Factory... and I was really hoping to eat there.  It wasn't until we made the trek up from the Mandalay that I realized Sugar Factory was gone.\n\nAnother small positive note - Hexx just opened, literally.  I think last Friday (Feb 27th) was it's first night.  So the place was still fairly empty at 7:30 pm on a Monday night.  \n\nMight be empty because it's so new, or might be empty because my friend isn't the only one to have spent the next day puking up her dinner.\n\nI visit Vegas a lot - and I'll keep an eye on their Yelp reviews to see if this was a one-time fluke.\n\nBottom line - should you go here?  If you want a great view of the fountain and fabulous spinach dip - give it a shot.  Just stay far away from anything else on the menu that might get you sick if it's not cooked/prepared properly.

My group wanted to get the fish bowls from sugar factory. We weren't going to go in until one of the hostesses outside explained that they just opened and that they also had a fishbowl type drink that uses fresh fruit instead of candy. We decided to give it a try and if you don't want to eat you can go directly to the bar. There were some long tables in that area too so we didn't have anywhere to stand or sit when we first went in. There were some tables alongside the glass wall when you first turn in but we didn't know if we could sit there. No one asked or assisted us so we just sat there. Those two tables were not really in the bar's line of sight so no one came to give us a menu or anything. I ended up walking up to the bar to order drinks. I stood there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be helped while the bartenders just passed me by. I finally flagged one of them down (Apparently they won't come to you unless you actually wave at them). I ordered two big fruit martinis (peach raspberry and mango orange). When they were brought to the table we asked for 2 more straws ( we had 4 people). They never brought them so one of my friends had to go back to the bar to get some. \nThe mango orange one was really sweet but I enjoyed the peach raspberry. It had a peach sake/soju cocktail flavor. They had a good amount of alcohol in them too. \nOur bartender came to tell us how much it was and didn't give us a check...just an amount. \nThis place just opened so hopefully they'll make some changes.", "business_id": "DptFOTAiKfGZJIFxmShwPw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 1, "date": "2015-03-08", "length": 324, "open": 0}

Our flight was delayed so we had time to figure out what we really wanted to eat before heading home. All the typical places at the terminal were pretty lame (Carl's Jr., Burger King, etc.), then we stumbled upon PGA Tour Grill. \n\nPGA Grill is spacious, inviting, bright, clean, and their staff actually like their job. We were greeted promptly and were offered drinks right away. The bartender was very friendly and helpful in giving us suggestions on the array of beers and alcohol they served. \n\nWe started off with the trio hummus and we were both pleasantly surprised on the flavor and freshness of the meal. The trio had edamame, smoked paprika, and lemon hummus with pita bread. The bread itself was crunchy on the outer rim and very soft and warm in the center. The trio also had a side of vegetable that was good and complimented the rest of the dish quite well. My favorite was the edamame and the smoked paprika. \n\nNext, Chris ordered the power burger which is a turkey burger and was cooked medium rare. There was just a tad bit too much mayo but was easily remedied by taking it off the bun. The portion was perfect. Not too big and not too small. He enjoyed the burger with his beer. I ordered the vegetarian avocado and hummus wrap. I actually liked it! The crispy spinach was light and fresh. It went well with the avocado and hummus. I would definitely order it again.  \n\nOverall, the experience here was great. Service was good and quick and the dining experience was great it makes airport food more enjoyable.

The Studio, G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time), The Blind Tiger speakeasy, The Gallery and The Prestige room. \n\nThe Studio room of course has a great collection of vinyls ranging from The Beatles, Madonna and to the current modern Justin Timberlake. The G.O.A.T. room had memorabilia of the greatest sports athletes jerseys of all time with autographs to commemorate with Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, etc. The Blind Tiger room was like walking into a closet that you wish you had with the intimate couches and shelving full of clothing to gaze at. The Gallery made you wish you had paid attention in photography class in high school so that your work of art was displayed in this room. And finally the Prestige room had shelving lined with plenty of Dom Perignon bottles making it a more upscale classy feel.\n\nJewel is another addition to the Hakkasan group list of clubs and its definitely setting its own bar.
