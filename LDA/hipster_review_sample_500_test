Their chicken choices definitely top my list over their steak (sometimes tough), beef (sometimes greasy), and pork (usually dry).  The chicken, in the words of Goldilocks, is \"just right.\"  Every time.  The regular chicken burrito (with extra hot salsa, please!) is always a winner.  However, when I'm in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz, I go with the pesto chicken burrito or formerly, the retired mole chicken burrito.   And when I'm in the mood for something naughty, I go with the queso chicken burrito.  The Naked Burritos (without the tortilla, for you low-carbers) are good...but I leave still feeling hungry.  \n\nSince we go to Qdoba regularly, we've signed up for the Qdoba Card, earn points each time we visit, and have gotten a handful of free burritos over the past few years.

It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.\n\nMy friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.\n\nI ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.

Enter the Lava Lounge at 2204 East Carson Street and you may think you are inside a volcano, or perhaps one of Jim Henson's creations; Fraggle Rock. Beyond the normal bar top and tables are protrusions of a rock like material in odd shapes only found in underground caves which insure intimacy of a small gathering. Beyond the bar is a fantastic room where bands perform and DJ's mix it up as young professionals and artsy types gather to dance. It's not unusual to huddle together in the circular booth hidden in an underground crater while watching college students twirling to \"The Dancing Queen\" on Friday evening's 80's night. Recently, a friend of mine and I ventured down to the Lava Lounge on a cold Friday evening. My friend decided to join the eclectic mix of people on the dance floor while I stood to the side of a rock formation sipping a drink and people watching. Since the room is dimly lit except for strobe light flashes from the dance floor, people watching is an unobvious sport and everyone does it. I just stood in wonderment at the mix of people, young and not so young, in a relaxed atmosphere without the pressures of the club scene to hit on someone of the opposite sex. After my friend tired herself out from dancing, we sat in a little rock alcove and enjoyed some crazy mixed drink concoctions. The Lava Lounge is a breath of fresh air and a good place to unwind after a fully loaded work week.\n\nThe Lava Lounge touts itself as \"Pittsburgh's most unique experience\" and it does not disappoint. All week long the Lava Lounge features different upbeat music genres including acid jazz, funk, disco, and alternative as well as one-of-a-kind mixed drinks. \n\nThe Lava Lounge has sister establishments along East Carson Street which include the Beehive Coffee House, The Tiki Lounge, and the newest addition; the Double Wide Grille.\n\nFor more information visit www.lavaloungepgh.com", "business_id": "sXPWMe-tQVP-XEEXtm9C5w", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2007-08-21", "length": 363, "open": 0}

I wouldn't say that I'm a coffee expert by any means, but the flavor of the coffee just really stood out above any other I have had in a long time.

The enchilada's were very different, light and fresh tasting. \n\nThe tuna sandwich was boring (Go to Taylor's Cafe for the best Tuna!!) but like Gabi said... the sweet potato chips are amazing and I had to beg the server to take them away from me so I would stop eating! \n\nOverall, I really liked this place for a weekend lunch joint!

Anyway, my employer was buying so what the heck.\n\nUpon arriving I noticed that this had to be one of the nicest Chili's i have ever been to.  I must have been recently remodeled.

Here is my breakdown:\n\n* Queso dip and chips - Of course my group had to order this because it was exactly what I needed....a yummy mess of cholesterol and calories.  Plus, I swear the stuff is addicting.  The chips are fresh and good and their salsa is also somehow very good and spicy.\n\n* Chicken Fajitas - I thought this to be one of their healthier meal options so I decided to give it a try.  They were very good.  I didn't have the tortillas, guac or the sour cream, but it didn't matter.  The sauteed onions, peppers, chicken and whatever else were very good all on their own.  I licked my plate clean.\n\n* Lava Cake topped with ice cream- Why do my coworkers do this to me?  I had a few bites and it was excellent.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself.  The same goes for that other dessert we got.  It was some ice cream over a brownie thing.\n\nI can't believe I'm giving this place 4 stars but it really wasn't too bad.

Edible?  Sure.  Mexican?  Not a chance.  My hopes were high; with a name like \"Two Hippies,\" I thought it would be a funky little place that served addictive street tacos... (I've never actually had *authentic* street tacos, but I KNOW they're not supposed to taste like THAT.)  \n\nMy friend tried the three taco combo; one carne asada, one green chili, and one fish taco - all on the low end of mediocre (though she couldn't even stomach the fish taco).  My burrito tasted like they wrapped bland beans, rice-a-roni, boiled chicken breast, and one ton of chopped onions inside a Mission tortilla.  Don't get me started on the chips and salsa either... Mission and Pace for sure...\n\nThe horrible part about all this is that the service was REALLY wonderful!  I think it was one of the owners who served me, and it was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had service-wise.  She had a distinct Midwestern charm; unfortunately, that's also what the \"Mexican\" food at Two Hippies suffers (severely) from.  \n\nVERDICT: Go to Rosita's or Juan's instead...\n\n(In response to Bryan L's callout:  1)  Yes, I'd take Bertos [or ROSITAS, or JUANS, or Chipotle] anyday over Two Hippies Beach House, and I'm not afraid to say it.

And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. \n\nI'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. \n\nThe Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. \n\nThe Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. \n\nThe Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. \n\nThe Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). \n\nAll in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.", "business_id": "d3MxUXS1b6U2P_gGuCO1-A", "second": 1, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2008-10-23", "length": 705, "open": 1}

SOOOOOOOOOOOOO fuckin awesome! Whoever thought of this mix must be part genius part hookah god.

Ok \"obsessed\" might be a little strong but what I mean is that I lived 5 minutes away, the beer was really cheap (student recommends deals ... which, by the way stop at 11pm and the staff never said a word when we each bought 3 pints at 10:55... sometimes they'd just give us the deal even if it was after 11.

The hostess was really nice and the layout was how it was described in the other reviews, very modern with the whole urban feel. I don't know but the bar area reminded me like a pei wei setup, and the whole leaning buddha frames seemed out of place. \n\nWith the ambience in place, I was looking forward to my sushi experience, so we waited at our table, and waited a few more, and waited... to the point of after 15 minutes of not getting any waters or seeing any sign of a server coming up to us, my antsy friends were asking me if I knew any other sushi place we could go to in the area. Oh maybe I should note the time we first sat down, it was 7:25PM. And the restaurant was somewhat busy, a large number of tables were filled, and it was really cold. \n\nFinally we were served water of which our server asked out drink orders and appetizers. We got ourselves an order of the calamari and the veggie tempura. then we waited... I have to admit we got our drink orders quite quick, I'd say 15 mins tops followed with our apps. The calamari in my opinion tasted interesting. My friend, S. described it as tasting like kung pao sauce with calamari it was sweet, yet had a little spice with red peppers, some mushrooms, onions. It's not a calamari that I would want to try again but it wasn't bad either. The veggie tempura was basic, some baby corn, yam, the usual in tempura batter, nothing special nothing unique. So let's talk about sushi. \n\nS. and I shared three rolls, they were the spicy yellowftail, the jade, and the zu. D. had the geisha and the eel cucumber. We were hungry and after eating our mediocre apps, we waited and waited, ok let's say service was slooooowwwwwww and when you have slow service and hungry sushi craving people, tempers flare and what was supposed to be a great dining experience suddenly becomes a bad one. \n\nWhen your server drops off hamachi yellowtail sashimi on the house because of the long wait, you know service is slow, and when you are told \"I'm sorry for the wait but we only have two sushi chefs in the back and alot of orders\" you know it's poor prep, and therefore slow service. \n\nThe hamachi sashimi was good but who serves sashimi without wasabi and sushi without wasabi and ginger? Apparently Moira does. And honestly why would I the customer have to ask a server at a sushi place for wasabi and ginger, I would think that's a basic requirement. So we waited close to 25 odd minutes for my friend D's rolls which were the geisha and the eel cucumber... 10mins later came our first roll the Jade, 10mins later the Zu.... and then my friend A. who ordered Sashimi and Negari, her oder came in 15 mins after. As you can see our orders didn't even come close to each other, so instead of us enjoying our meal together, it was like watching one person eat while the others waited. We finally got our last roll, the spicy yellowtail 20 mins after A.'s order. And got our check at 9:10PM. I enjoy a leisurely dinner when I'm out with friends but something I choose to have and not because a restaurant's poor service is forcing me to have a loooong dinner. \n\nAlright sushi not phenonmenol sushi accompanied by a slow inattentive service made my night out at Moira not that great. Servers should attempt to check on their customers every so often, I feel that they seemed shorthanded given it was a Wed. evening but still that is no excuse for slow service. I don't believe I'll come back to Moira again. I just felt shortchanged that something with promise could have turned out for the best but in this instance it marred my sushi night out. it's a thumbs down for Moira.", "business_id": "xs1LHeJy78u-7taSEnQ2Yw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2009-04-02", "length": 876, "open": 0}

We decided to stop by here in favor of Postino, as we have already been multiple times, and boy am I glad we did.  This is like the 4th or 5th, or maybe 12th different restaurant inside the ever-so-lovely Clarendon Hotel.  In what seems to be a revolving door of restaurant concepts in this rather charming space, I think we have finally found a winner.\n\nGallo Blanco does something that not enough restaurants do.  They downsize their menu drastically to have only a few different options for lunch/dinner, and a few options for breakfast, plus a few assorted appetizers.  I much prefer a restaurant to have a few things on the menu that they perfect rather than a whole bunch of items that are only so-so.  The dinner menu offers a few entrees including steak and chicken and then there are tortas or tacos with your choice of delectable meat stuffed inside.  The husband and I ordered the cheese crisp (not what you think) and the pork sandwiches.  I would give the Spanish names, but I've got nothing for ya.  \n\nThe cheese crisp was a fantastic giant fried concoction.  It seems like it was a large tortilla, or something, covered in cheese and deep fried wrapped around something round.  It was really good, I can't describe it much better, just get it if you go.  The pork tortas were so delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  it was mixed with some shredded lettuce, a couple slices of fresh avocado, and there was a delightfully tangy/spicy sauce underneath.  The bread was unbelievably tasty, slightly sweet with a perfect texture.  I was excited to actually have a true torta bun instead of your average run of the mill hamburger bun.  We decided to split the chocolate pudding for dessert.  It was served in a small tumbler.  The chocolate pudding wasn't a traditional pudding and was much thinner.  However, it went perfectly with the graham crackers and the truly homemade marshmallow fluff.  The marshmallow stuff was soooooo good and you can taste the quality.  A tasty yet simple dessert.\n\nWhat a great experience!  I only took away one star because the restaurant was far from busy but the wait for food was a little too long to be deemed acceptable.  However, our server was so sweet and charming, and her English accent was almost unbearably adorable.  It was her first day on the job but she was phenomenal.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone and I hope we finally have a permanent resident in the Clarendon restaurant space.", "business_id": "-sC66z4SO3tR7nFCjfQwuQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2009-04-27", "length": 449, "open": 0}

It was a nightmare.  It was only my second time eating out since I had been diagnosed.  I had heard they had a gluten free (GF) menu.  When I asked for it, they brought me a dirty binder that had about 75 typed pages in it.  In one section of the binder, they said a certain dish was GF, and then in another section it said it wasn't GF (and it was one of the desserts that you knew had gluten in it just from hearing the name, I can't recall which it was now).  When I found a chicken dish that sounded good, I cross-referenced the regular menu to read a description of the dish since the binder didn't have one.  The dish wasn't in the regular menu.  When I asked the waitress about it, she said they no longer made the dish.  So, to summarize, the GF menu was contradictory, out-of-date, and had no dish descriptions or pictures.  By the time I ordered after about 20 minutes of examining the menu and quizzing the waitress, my hubby was starving and I was almost in tears.

They had a \"tasting menu\" going (none of the items on the regular menu were available):\n\n1.  Kalbi rib slider\n2.  Beef & cheddar slider\n3.  Mac & cheese slider\n\nUnfortunately, the Mac & cheese had already sold out by the time I got there (around 1pm).  I ended up with two of each the others, at $3/per.  I've posted some cell-phone pics of my order for everybody to check out.\n\nThe Kalbi Rib slider was served on a lightly grilled bun about 2.5-to-3 inches in diameter.  The boneless beef rib had been prepared in a shoyu/garlic/ginger marinade (nice!) and topped with some grilled cabbage which gave some crunchy texture contrast.  The protein was a bit toothsome, but nothing that would turn you off... actually  I remember thinking that the substantial bun was well-paired with the chosen internals.  Overall, I was digging the Kalbi sliders...  I wonder now if a -tiny- bit of mayonaisse could have been added to the bun.  Mayo would have definitely made the flavor profile more reminiscent of the teri-beef burgers you get at local drive-ins in Hawaii. \n\nNow for the Beef & Cheddar slider:  A person who likes fresh colors and contrasting textures might find this slider too one-dimensional.  Before I picked it up, I was expecting it to be a greasy slog, but instead I was pleasantly surprised at how well the buttery croissant had held it's saucy fill.  The beef was something like you'd find in a traditional philly steak, thin-cut, chopped, lean and well-done.  It had been topped with what I'm guessing was the bechamel cheese sauce from the sold-out mac & cheese slider.  The sauce was rich!  After two of these bad boys I was feeling _HEAVY_.  All items at the Slider Truck are made to order, and that's a good thing because any more than the few minutes between pick-up and consumption would turn the Beef & Cheddar slider into a funky, soggy mess.\n\nI'm going to give three stars today, because my order was fresh and flavorful.  I'd like to revisit the Slider Truck when it's serving up it's full menu, plus a couple tasting items.

I'd happily visit again and again with a group of friends, but it's out of the way enough I don't see myself seeking it out on my own. There's a ton of potential for the space. If someone's involved that can put together events that make good use, Phoenix may have a new hot spot.\n\nThere are so many things going on here I'm going to have to break it up to tackle it.\n\n- The building (five stars)\nIt's a cool repurposed warehouse. Lots of intentionally retro touches. The different areas flow into each other. There is the food area, which is open air because the roof burned down a few years ago and they decided to keep it that way that serves food out of a 60s travel trailer, the bar that was transplanted from a rat pack era Chicago jazz club, and the retail area which has vintage clothing, novelties, will have produce, and houses the gym, an area with stadium benches and an LCD projector, the coffee shop, and the soda shop. I wonder how they plan to keep an open food area tolerable once the heat of summer sets in.\n\n- The food (three stars, four if the prices were better)\nThere's a brunch menu, a selection of sliders, salads, a hot dog stand, a couple dinner items, and some deserts. They're obviously going for fun and casual. I had $8 meatball sliders and liked them, the bread was good, and the tomato sauce tasted savory and homemade. The price seems a little high to consider eating them for lunch though. I discounted the hot dogs this visit, but thinking about it, I'm kicking myself for not seeing if they offer a real chicago style loaded dog, because Chicago street food staples should be the focus of the food here. I actually wish the experience was a little more \"street food.\"\n\n- The drinks (same as the food)\nThey have a selection of $4 beers, fruit juices, and several cocktails served in jars. I had a spiked lemonade, and enjoyed it, though I hate paying $11 for any drink. It had decent lemon flavor and came with berries in it. If you're with a group they have a large size for almost double the price that gave two of the people I was with two glasses each. Seems like a better deal, but they way they talked their drinks had to have been more watered down (from melted ice) than mine was. They really need to offer (reverse) happy hour specials.\n\n- The coffee (four stars)\nI don't know where the beans are sourced or roasted, I should have asked. But the prices were great, $1.90 for bottomless drip, I had a decent mocha for under $3. The coffee shop has a walk up window facing the street, which I thought was a nice touch. \n\n- The retail (two stars)\nNot everything was done / operational in this area during my visit. As far as the what I did see, it was mostly novelty. I'm too cheap to pay over $50 for any item of vintage clothing. My friend found a neat bartender's cup with tools and cocktail recipes for $12. The gym is $5 per use, but seems like more of a novelty than even the clothes.\n\nIf you go by what Mayor Gordon and the owner Steve Rosenstein said tonight after their Chicago lovefest, I witnessed the rebirth of an old downtown scene by attending The Duce's opening night. They talked about a scene called the deuce, based in an area along Second Street that used to be a vibrant part of Phoenix. The vision is to bring that back to Phoenix by renovating the old produce warehouse district. The Duce\u2122 (get the double reference now) is intended to be the seed of big change in the area. Time will tell if I witnessed history in the making, I certainly hope so, but I'm already seeing the typical backtalk about the owners and food (some of which I don't necessarily disagree with). Ryan C says this place is just cashing in on projected nostalgia. It's way too soon for me to be able to make that call.", "business_id": "OdD1GuGNQ64ssJmMJ_D9RQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2010-05-09", "length": 726, "open": 1}

There are three outdoor bars, an outdoor grill to grab food, and a kiosk for pool amenities, all in short walking distance no matter which pool you're located by. \n\nLocal women are free Fridays through Sundays.

It's a good place for either a quick drink or spending the evening with friends.  It has recently been remodeled and has a nice clean atmosphere.  \n\nThere was a small mixed crowd when I visited; everyone was friendly and having a good time.  We were all enjoying the cool mix of techno, blues and oldschool rock.  It was just my style.  The bartender was hot and friendly and the drinks were great too.\n\nThere there is a nicely-sized bar in the center with a few tables around the walls.  There is a large adjoining room that would be perfect for gatherings, or to belt out some tunes during Karaoke on Wednesday nights! There are plenty of HD TV's for sports and other entertainment too.\n\nThe biggest surprise was the excellent food.  They serve a full menu of mostly Asian, but I'm sure you could get most anything you wanted.  I tried the shrimp Pad-Thai, upon recommendation of the barkeep (shoutout to Daisy :) and it was, very good.  The prices are fair and the quality was high.  They even have little wooden trays that sit on the edge of the bar, so you can continue your video poker play while you eat.  I love it!!!\n\nIt's an easy place to get to and there is plenty of parking too.  It's just west of the old Sahara, so most of the surrounding area is currently pretty empty.

( I went for the grand opening on 4/1 as part of first friday.) \n\nTo start, I want to say that this place has GREAT potential. I saw several small issues that for now I will chalk up to opening day jitters. However, the staff seems genuine, which is a rarity all over town, and the arts district is no different. \nThe manager allowed me in even though they weren't quite open, and the bartenders were beyond friendly and all smiles and \"thank yous\" despite some confusion. I felt like they were truly grateful for my business.\nThey absolutely stole my heart when I saw they had stocked red plastic \"to go\" cups to help serve the First Friday crowd. \nThe stereo system is amazing, and they blasted out a few songs throughout the night at full volume (undoubtedly to show the kiddies what their top notch system could really do.) which leaves me in anticipation of things to come in the music department. Although I have to say I'm concerned about who is doing the music and how...I was there probably a total of 3 hours in and out throughout the night, and at least 2 songs were repeated during that time period. If you are going to have a juke box this is inevitable, but when they are controlling the music I can't image having a playlist so short that you are repeating songs in such a short time period.\n\nLater in the night I moved with a group of Yelpers and we took over the back booth in the front room. The wraparound couch in this section is a great place to meet with a large group or to use as an excuse to get to know your neighbors sitting near you. There is actually a lot of this at Artifice and all of the seating, whether intentional or not facilitates talking to the people around you. I am always a big fan of this in any bar. However, there was only one cocktail waitress for all 3-4 seating areas. So, in short, there seemed to be one girl running around serving 30-40 people, and 4 bartenders serving 20-25 people. This made for a slightly longer wait time for our round of drinks than I would normally be willing to wait.\nArtifice could be exactly what the Art district needs, which is a spacious, but unpretentious place to act as a pivot point for the area. It's location on the perimeter of the First Friday blocks but steps closer to Downtown will undoubtedly create a new destination and it's size will easily accommodate the overflow from other places as well as those not wanting to stand in line on weekends. \nI'm not sure why they have a 1 am closing time. If this is not a zoning restriction they will most certainly have to eventually extend this. It is just an expectation of the city that will have to be reckoned with. The fact that they have their own lot, alone is going to make this a meet-up destination for the downtown crowd.\nDrink prices are practical and right in line with other similar places. I had a single well drink, and two draft Stellas and my bill was $15.\nThe back area through the curtains is where I'm sure they will eventually set up shop for resident and upcoming DJ's which will make the space less awkward. For now It will just serve as a place to stand while you are waiting on a bar seat or booth table. The art on the walls is unique and fits seamlessly into this area. My understanding is that everything is local. \n\nArtifice is a place to keep an eye on, because as I've already said...This place has GREAT potential.", "business_id": "mygV--nIcIbUvynercSb4g", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2011-04-03", "length": 660, "open": 1}

I don't have the most discerning coffee palate, but this stuff is good... nothing like what your friend roasts in their air popper.\n\nThey have brewed coffee (I can't remember for the life of me if he does espresso) in addition to 6-8 by-the-pound offerings that were extremely freshly roasted... my pound was still warm! Averages around $13/lb.\n\nThe storefront is pretty no-nonsense bare bones, don't worry about tromping a little snow inside or bringing in your bike with you to grab your coffee.\n\nThe proprietor (I forget his name) is extremely friendly and welcomes a chat. He'll also do custom roasts for you, no minimum I'm pretty sure, especially handy if you want a half decaf blend or the like. I recommend calling ahead if you have a large order, as well.\n\nHours are hard to find online, but I posted a photo of what was on the door as of today.", "business_id": "wnb0VquMa65hYUUPISGD1Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2012-01-23", "length": 216, "open": 0}

Seriously, highest concentration of hairdressers in Scotland. Admittedly, I was in the area for a haircut, but after being assaulted by 35 different barbers/stylists/coiffeurs I needed to regroup, drink some coffee and just go to the cheapest. \nSecondly, I'd had THE BEST coffee I'd drank since I left Australia at the other Artisan Roast store and I was keen to see if they could back it up. \nBack it up they did!\nThe girl serving told me she was new and asked me how I wanted my coffee: More bitter or more acidic. Even though I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, I was SO excited that she asked me... I must look like I know coffee! So I shrugged, said \"black\", sat down and listened to her ask every customer that came in \"More bitter or more acidic?\" \nIt was imagined coffee cred!\nAnyway the coffee was really good, it wasn't burnt, it was a good temperature and wasn't outrageously bitter. It was a fun place to chill out and drink good coffee. I like that there isn't really a bar/counter, it's more of an open kitchen room with a 'mooch spot'. Also, there's plenty of street-poetry books/zines lying around, so if you really want to look 'hip', 'groovy' or 'happening' you can do what I did and stare at the pages of one of them for a while.\nSo, in the words of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper,\n\"Damn fine coffee\"", "business_id": "WvvHWkRSWqBiNKr1LAmJqA", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2011-10-17", "length": 280, "open": 1}

Knowing there was a Starbucks nearby but wanting something a bit more novel I pulled up the Yelp locator and noted a familiar name from my research on the city; Cartel Coffee Lab, apparently a new location filling the space of a now defunct store that used to serve their beans.  Having heard good things about their sourcing, roasting, and brewing I made my way into the small store to find a number of folks lounging, surfing the web, and enjoying their coffee and on making my way to the counter I was met by not only a prompt and friendly barista, but also a knowledgeable one who asked what I liked in a coffee (full, thick, cocoa, low acid for those curious) and he spot-on recommended the Ethiopian Dark Roast at $3/8oz or $16.99/lb.\n\nTaking his suggestion while discussing the other six varieties available I was quoted prices, terroir, and tasting notes as he prepared my single drip and with options ranging from $12.99 for 12oz to $29.99 for 12oz I was told that all were available by the cup if I wanted to taste - a mental note well engrained for my next trip to the area.  With coffee prepared and limited options for sweetener (muscovado sugar or Agave nectar only) I opted to drink it black and sipping the brew the flavor was spot on to what I appreciate - velvety, cocoa tinged, and a bit of cherry and almond.

We went with Groupons, cutting the $65 down to $30, but honestly -- I would have paid the full price. If you're not in a large group of girls, don't have friends working at clubs, or aren't willing to drop to drop a couple grand, having a good time at clubs in Vegas can be daunting. Club Crawl makes it simple. Honestly, there's always one person in a group of friends who's responsible for making decisions and shepherding everyone along... and it's usually the Yelper of the group. It was nice to let that all go, let the hostess handle the logistics, and just have fun!\n\nWe went on a Friday: Dick's, Coyote Ugly, Rok, LAX, Cathouse, Nikki Beach. They aren't the most exclusive clubs on the Strip, but I definitely had a great time. I don't think we would had the resources or the energy to hop through so many clubs otherwise.\n\nThere was a fair bit of walking, but the casinos are pretty close to each other, so the routes were pretty well planned. Rok was slow when we got there, but it picked up; LAX was definitely the most popular. Nikki Beach was honestly pretty dead, but it would be a BLAST in the summer when the pools are open! We skipped all the lines, no covers, and free drinks and 2 for 1 deals at the first few places. Our hostess was the sweetest, and got us taxis for the short distance between Cathouse and Nikki Beach at the end of the night.\n\nWe were told my experience was kind of abnormal; they presumably have groups of anywhere from 40 to over a hundred. Our group numbered... 7 on the Friday after Thanksgiving? Kind of weird, but it was actually really nice & fun getting to know everyone in such a small group-- especially when the drinks started flowing :-)-- but I think it would have been just as fun in a larger group. There is plenty of opportunity to make friends, or to just do your own thing. You get about an hour at each location, but if you feel particularly attached to a club, you're welcome to ditch the crawl and stay there.\n\nAbsolutely no complaints.

I am perhaps the world's greatest critics of Indian / Nepalese restaurants as I know what I like and they often don't live up to my standards.  I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.  \n\nI'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!  \n\nThe interior of this place is really cool, it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.  \n\nI saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for \u00a34.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.  \n\nI went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it, it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.  \n\nMy companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich, tomato / barbeque style sauce.  As I said, not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)\n\nAnother good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.  \n\nFor main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact, I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think, 'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants, they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.  \n\nMy fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable, we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above, although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.  \n\nWe ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely, lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.  \n\nThis place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location, the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful, good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!  \n\nAs if you can't tell already, I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.  Honestly, the only thing left to say is try it for yourself.

All awesome.\n\nThen, THEN... The butternut squash soup.  Rarely am I impressed with presentation, but this delivered.\nAll three of us ordered it....\nThey brought three shallow bowls out - that did not contain soup.\nthey included a link of goat sausage (grilled and sliced), a larger-than-a-dollop of goat cheese, fried kale, and maybe some fried garlic cloves.\nThen, THEN... they had a tea kettle filled with the soup that they poured over the previously mentioned deliciousness.  Wow. it was good. (the sausage may have been heavy on the lavender seasoning, but that is parallel to me saying Michelangelo was heavy handed on the sistine chapel)\n\nThen there were entrees. \nI'm going to assume these will probably change on a semi-regular basis, but what we had tonight was awesome.\n\nWe were already full.

So frustrated. \n\nAs I left, 20 minutes later, with my burritos to go now since they took forever, I could only shake my head as I walked by their table, still enjoying they food. \n\nAnd to make matters even worse... I walk down their hall way to see water running out the kitchen door down the hall way. I do an about-face and walk up to the manager to inform him of the issue, before I could even get the words out of my mouth he says \"The water? yeah I know\" I gave him a \"Are you f------ serious?!\" look, and left.

A festival that started out very unorganized and haphazard has become a regular fixture on my monthly calendar.\n\nI still am not sure how they decide which Saturday they are going to do this event. I've been the day after First Friday and I've been in the middle of the month.\n\nPart of the reason this gets 5 stars from me is that I live at The Ogden, so I literally walk down stairs from my place and BAM! Food Truck heaven. plus I like the addition of the local vendors selling their hand crafted wares. I'm not gonna buy most of it because its just not my style, but I'm all about small local vendors getting their shot. \n\nThere's always a few regulars and a few change-ups each month. You can almost always count on Slidin Thru and Grouchy John's but the rest vary from month to month. And it's always a good mix of people in attendance. It's an all ages event so it usually draws that same crowd you see at First Friday, & it's FREE to get in so if you are in the area there is definitely no good reason to not check it out.\n\nMy one main complaint is that there's around 4 or 5 tables total for the event. Therefore, there is always that awkward time after buying the food of walking around trying to find some place to post up and eat. For an event with as many attendees as this tends to get, and as much extra room as they have in the parking lot, whoever is in charge needs to get on this. It's a tiny little omission that would make a huge difference in the quality of the event.", "business_id": "O8H9ikB4MxegisuDa7imsw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2012-02-11", "length": 317, "open": 0}

There are so many new incredible restaurants in Montreal - it's actually hard to keep up. I love it. I do believe that the city's nightlife scene could use the same kind of facelift...\n\nToday, I'm raving about Pastaga - a new restaurant that opened just a couple months ago on St-Laurent Boulevard below Little Italy. Don't be fooled - it's not Italian. \"Pastaga\" is actually another name for Pastis, the French anise-flavored alcohol enjoyed as an ap\u00e9ritif. Accordingly, restaurant puts a modern twist on French-bistro cuisine and d\u00e9cor. \n\nWhat's the deal? Small plates (2-3/person for a full meal) and a focus on biodynamic wine (without headache-prompting tannins). A chill, unpretentious atmosphere. Delicious food delivered by fun waiters. A table in the kitchen that invites diners to watch \"the game\", all while keeping the dinner crowd happy and unaware of the TV. And Twin Shadow as background music? Pastaga definitely wins when it comes to first impressions.\n\nFirst, my friend and I tried the crispy yellow pike with pumpkin pur\u00e9e and rapini salad. Delightful. The fish was delicate, flaky, and cooked to the perfect point. The pumpkin pur\u00e9e and the rapini added some sweet-smooth and bitter-crunchy flavour and texture.\n\nNext, we had the waffle with saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms, greens, and slivers of Parmesan. Again, yum! It's nouveau - mother country gone new world, shall we say - and it works.\n\nOur third dish was the bison - a mini steak atop pulled meat, shredded parsnips and a slightly BBQ'd-style sauce. Another hit. Especially the pulled bison. For me it was a first, and certainly not a last.\n\nFinally, have you heard of their piglet belly lacquered with brown sugar placed atop a parsnip pancake? If not, be forewarned. This won't stay a secret for long. It was insane! Divine. It melted in my mouth. And with that pancake? Whoa boy. Whoaaaaa boy.\n\nJust in case Pastaga hadn't wowed us enough already, the restaurant seriously \"brought it\" with dessert. Per the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the little begnets (mini donut \"balls\") filled with apple sauce accompanied by two oval \"scoops\" of vanilla ice-cream, little dollops of caramel cream, baked apple \"chips\", pieces of saut\u00e9ed apple and apple butter. Again, amazing. And a portion big enough for two.\n\nPastaga has been getting some well-deserved buzz lately, and you definitely want in on the action. Book ahead and don't tell your friends. (Just kidding.)\n\n\nFood 9.5/10, Atmosphere 9.5/10, Pretty people 9/10, Music (perfect volume) 9/10, Service 9.5/10.\n\n\nPictures: http://belledenuitmontreal.com/2012/03/02/pastaga/", "business_id": "dBuvwAHFrw_2ZJOUxYAVDg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2012-03-02", "length": 456, "open": 0}

After hearing this is the spot to be for those who like Electronic music, I was very eager and excited to have a reason to come downtown, and happy to go to this place after our event. \n\nWe showed up at 11 pm. This place was damn near empty. It was Friday. I have liked this place on Facebook, and they are always advertising \"Fusion Fridays\", where there is 1 dollar Bud Lights and 2 for 1 drinks until 11. \n\nWe got there right after the specials ended, and the drinks were normal club prices. Ladies got in free, for dudes it was 10 bucks. \nThey were mixed really weak, and truthfully, I wish they had something better to choose from beer wise.\n\nThe sound system was great. I mean, the bass was awesome, but not overpowering. It was on par with the other parts of the audio spectrum. IT WAS REALLY REALLY LOUD. As an \"audiophile\", I found this to be the only good quality on this particular night. The DJ was local, but there wasn't really anyone dancing. The place was slowly filling up as we left.\n\nWhy did we leave? Well, the music was not to my liking. In any club, the DJ plays and caters to the crowd; so the music went from hip hop mixing to regaton. I was there with my girlfriend to dance, but was hoping for the EDM DJ who played earlier in the night. As soon as the regaton started bumping, everyone kept dancing, and of course it kept getting mixed song after song. The crowd was primarily latino at that point, and because of the vibe and the music we decided to go next door to BarSmith (see my review on that place as well).\n\nI will only be back to see a DJ that I like spin.

It had been packed the previous weekend, with a front window that opens up onto the great terrasse on Avenue Mont-Royal.  Terrasse was unfortunately closed on this particular night as the permit was in transition, so we sat inside.\n\nOur fab serveuse, Emilie, was very quick to serve us and knowledgeable on the beers on tap.  Saint-Sacrament has house blonde and rousse brews, the former of which isn't stupendous in terms of taste but is rather good, and one could imagine sinking quite a few over the course of a Saturday night.  Other beers on tap include Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Alexander Keith's, and a couple others -- nothing out-of-the-ordinary.\n\nThe bar seemed not quite as well-stocked as it could be, but the place does not profess to be a nightclub or cocktail bar, and Emilie was able to improvise where necessary.  It is, quite directly, a tavern.\n\nAmbiance was really where Saint-Sacrament has things kicking on all cylinders.  Amazing long wooden tables made from reclaimed wood are at bar-stool height, and are great for larger groups.  (I anticipate if you show up at a decent hour on a weekend, you won't have to contort to ask for chairs from other tables.)  Fantastic tin ceiling.  There are about four or five individual and properly-interior-designed washrooms in the back.  Place is spotless, and the music is fantastic: good mix of Rolling Stones (\"Bitch\"!  Hadn't heard that in years), Johnny Cash, and other proper pub music blasting over a great sound system.  After cranking the music up louder at one point, one of the proprietors actually came over to make sure our table wasn't disturbed by the volume, since we were right under the speaker.  Nice touch there, too.  (Considering the quality of the music we weren't disturbed at all.)  There's at least one TV in there; it was being used for a Euro repeat when we arrived, but as the night wore on it was shut off in favour of the music, which is entirely proper for any reputable establishment.\n\nDidn't try any of the food, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked nice.  Prices for the beer and liquor are very modest for a watering hole that has a proper sense of design and great service about it.

Floor to ceiling windows, the shiny blue floors, and fresh white walls give this place tons of natural light. It's the perfect place to meet friends or read a book, and there is even a huge bookcase of take-one-leave-one books and board games for patrons to enjoy. Almost all of the tables were up-cycled and renovations done by Boris and Grant themselves, two of the smilest guys on the planet.\n\nCome in for a quick coffee and donut, or stay and make friends.

A spicy bean/smoked tofu would certainly make a nice addition...\n\nThere was little room for dessert (at only three tacos each and beverages we were stuffed) but we shared a home made chocolate bar (a dense, chocolate cookie bar). I liked the concept but the actual dessert left something to be desired. If it had been moister or glazed with a cinnamon-chocolate ganache it might have stood out. As it stood - it sat. \n\nYes, Mais is currently a hot spot. No, it's not your authentic Texan taco feast at $1.25 apiece with a variety of amazing salsas, fresh cilantro etc. BUT that being said it was a night well spent.

The wonderful tastes.\n\nBefore I tell you about the dishes we had, I want to note that the meat here was top notch. Instead of buying ground beef, the owner (a very friendly young Canadian fellow) buys steaks and grinds them up himself. The result; steak texture with burger appeal. I had the Poutine Burger and it definitely blew my mind. I got some extra gravy on the side and I sat and eat in a near comatose state of delight. My girlfriend got the Mac and Cheese Burger which was equally delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and you can see the place is still \"coming together\" (it doesn't have a liquor license yet) but that sort of gives it the \"it's real\" charm.

It had a very mild flavor and a texture similar to ricotta, but slightly creamier. It was served with a grilled bread, diced pears, and chopped walnuts then drizzled with a bacon syrup.  I was not overwhelmed with this dish, and would have preferred a healthier serving a pears and more sauce to add additional sweetness. \n\nThe entrees for the evening were the pork ribs and trout. The meat on the ribs was plentiful and tender and sure to satisfy the greatest of carnivores. Although, the standout of the dish was the barbecue sauce. It was deliciously spicy and sweet, finger-lickin' good. Barely worth mentioning were the lackluster fries and coleslaw. Both were just passable and definitely expected more considering the price of the dishes.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the trout. It looked rather lonely on the plate, with a dense line of green beans and almonds accompanying it. It was slightly overcooked, with one side being nearly perfect and tender, while the other was slightly crispy and just a bit dry. This being said it was still quite edible and the buttery sauce accented the filet nicely.\n\nWe finished the meal with the cinnamon apple brioche and vanilla gelato. The brioche was served in a cool mini cast iron pan. It seemed to be immersed in cinnamon and sugar, and just far too sweet. The gelato was just okay and was one small sad scoop. Not too much flavor or sweetness here, and that may be a good thing. The brioche was definitely begging for a bit of mellow. \n\nLastly, we enjoyed a couple cocktails as well. I had the El Matador and the Smashed Irishman. While I almost exclusively drink beer, these drinks were excellent and I would happily order them again. Both seemed to have nearly the perfect balance of sweetness, bitterness, and alcohol. My favorite of the two would have to be the El Matador as I am partial to tequila. If the meal were not comped our bill would have been exactly $100 (excluding tax and tip.)\n\nAlmost forgot to mention the venue, which may be the most appealing factor of all. It has a massive covered patio with modern decor, trees dispersed throughout, very nice heaters, and an assortment of games which included ping pong, cornhole, foosball, and shuffleboard. I could definitely see myself going back, brown baggin' it (the beer special) and playing some drunken games.

Celebrating local food as well as healthy choices, they offer Paleo options, vegan options, and are happy (as in MORE than happy) to accommodate any food concerns you may have. Believe me, even when working for a health food store, dealing with everyone's little allergies and food habits were really stressful, even frustrating at times.

I may upgrade it to 4 stars if they succeed in working out some of their growing pains.\n\nAfter much delay (something about tea being held in customs for a month), Dobra Tea opened its door just this past weekend. It seems to be trying to pack multiple tea-drinking cultures (e.g., Turkish, India, East Asian, etc.) all into one tiny room. I appreciate the concept, but I'm not sure if the execution is entirely successful. (For example, the place has a nice spicy aroma, but that wouldn't jive very well with a delicate Chinese white tea, say.)\n\nSome of my initial reactions:\n1) Their service format is not quite practical. A customer comes in, they offer you a seat, bring you a (long) menu and a little bell. You ring the bell to call over the wait person to order. They present you your tea service in dainty tea wares. When you are done, you ring the bell again to get the check. You settle the bill at the cash register.  Based on my observation of multiple teashops (many started off like this), this will not work in the long run.\n\n2) The menu is extensive (it is over 60 pages long). This is both a good thing and a bad thing. I love loose tea, so I appreciate that they offer such a wide range of choices.  However, I do wonder whether much of the less popular teas might become stale (I suppose they could regularly dump out older teas, but that would really hurt their profit margins). For any person new to teas, this menu may be a bit daunting. \n\n3) The snack, dessert menu is also a bit all over the map. They plan to offer standard coffee shop items like brownies, middle eastern desserts like baklava, savories like olives and hummus, east asian sweets, and more substantial snacks as well. Again, the diverse offering will make keeping everything well stocked difficult. Today, my first choice of a pastry item was not available (they apologized and explained that they just opened) and my second choice (baklava) tasted a little stale already.\n\n4) There is wifi, but you have to ask for a password. I didn't bother.\n\n5) The price is higher than other teashops/cafes.\n\nDobra Tea sits diagonally across from Te Cafe. The two places set up an interesting contrast with each other. Te Cafe is bright and spacious and a bit Starbucks-ish. Dobra Tea has more of a warm, dark, and cozy ambiance. Te Cafe seems to be primarily courting (grad) students. Dobra Tea may be hoping to attract die-hard tea enthusiasts. Are there enough of us in Pittsburgh to keep it afloat?

Gone is that horrific canopy that blocked every ray of sunshine from pouring through those tall windows. The space is now bright and fresh. There's been some counter re-adjustment, so the area between you and your barista is more open and accessible... like a cafe should be. There's a way cool pour over station with crazy digital scales that have more buttons than a novice like me understands, a station built by Cait's father. And as for the coffee... it's incredible. Anoydye from Milwaukee. These guys are also in bands, different bands and if you ever get a chance to hear Cait sing, you're in for a treat. Music is part of their life and it's part of their concept. Eye over the website or Facebook page for awesome acts weekly. The acoustics are incredible.\n\nNow how do I know all of this? Because they're not afraid to share. It also helps that I always have a million questions because I write reviews in my head, but I can't take all the credit.

I already planned to try Renegade after Restaurant Week ended, so imagine my surprise to find an invitation via text last night to attend today's Grand Opening VIP Tasting!  (I'd just arrived from a terrific RW dinner at Sassi when I received the text.)  I received the confirmation email this morning asking guests to arrive in casual attire.\n\nArrived before the place started to get crowded.  Spied a couple of old acquaintances, and we decided to sit together.  (Had a great time catching up with you, Chris and Heather!)  Glad we moved to a table close to the musicians playing at the front- Jared Blackstone sang and played guitar, while another would join in on keyboards from time to time.  He did covers ranging from Rob Thomas and Johnny Cash to Pearl Jam and The Beatles.  So good was the music tonight that Heather and I went and bought CDs.  I hope he's on regular rotation at Renegade...\n\nBefore moving to the table, we sat at the bar, where Heather and I immediately were given ribbon-tied plastic bags filled with fruit-infused rum cocktails finished with Kool-Aid.  I couldn't have any, so I gave mine to Chris.  At the table, Heather ordered a glass of Earthquake Zin, and I a Rosemary Margarita, which had an ice cube made up of a rosebud and rosemary sprigs!

The first serving I had, I concentrated on the different flavors and textures of the sweet dish-- smoky fennel mixing with the creamy goat cheese, and the nutty fennel pollen amidst the silky goat cheese cream- oh la la!  We were practically begging for more!  When we finally got seconds of it, a server actually brought out a covered smoking tray, stopped in front of our table, waited till it dawned on us what we were about to receive, and then lifted the cover, and out drifted smoke!  This time, the fennel pollen tasted even smokier than the first batch, and then I finally had to stop and shake my head, because darn it, I'm eating out of an ashtray!  I'm sure it painted quite a picture to see me, a non-smoker who abhors the habit (I work in a smoke-infested environment), eating out of an ashtray with glee!\n\nWe each took a parting gift of Mole Gold 24K gold-infused EVOO and a set of headphones in a paint can on our way out, and I asked the artist I'd passed a couple of times on my way to the restroom, he had an unfinished canvas next to him, if he was responsible for some of the artwork adorning the walls; he said yes.

Because when the food is well made, the service is impeccable and the ambiance is top, there is no reason not to! \n\nMange-moi is an elegant poutinerie and one of those \"fancy-looking\" burger places that have been popping up around town recently. The decor is rustic modern, perhaps a little bit too \"right now\" and might go out of style in the future, but in any case it works, it's comfortable and fits the neighbourhood like a glove. It's small, with only about 5 x 2-person tables inside plus 10-15 single bar chairs around - perfect if you feel like rocking in solo. \n\nThe burger and poutine menus offer a nice, classic variety. My choice was their \"Mont-Royal\" burger which is a beef burger with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, barbecue sauce, Boston lettuce and tomato. It was pure goodness, which I think owed a lot to the sweet burger buns that held everything together. The fries and the caesar salad were excellent as well, and of generous proportions. My husband and I shared the fries and the salad that came with my burger (he ordered only the burger), and it was more than enough. The alcoholic drinks menu is interesting too, though the cocktails at $12 a pop were beyond my dinner budget, so I didn't order any. \n\nHaving said all those good things, my biggest compliments actually go to either the service or the music. It's a very tight race. We were served by one of the nicest, most competent servers I have ever encountered in a burger place. Aside from being very friendly, he topped up our glasses of water as often as needed (the glass was tiny) without us having to ask.  As for the music, when I was there that evening, they were playing an international remix of 80's dance/pop; there was never a dull moment, at least for me! It was so good I asked the server if they were playing their homemade CD because if it was, I would love to buy it. Sadly no, he said that it was from a satellite radio. \n\nHands-down, best burger place in the Plateau Mont-Royal.

Il se situe au 3459 Notre-Dame Ouest, c'est juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du march\u00e9 Atwater.\n\nAvant de commencer, si vous voulez juste savoir si vous devez y aller ou non : Vous devez y aller. Pour les autres, je continue avec ma critique.\n\nPour ceux qui ne le savent pas, j'aime bien l'indien. J'ai essay\u00e9 le Cari Mela dans le coin qui \u00e9tait pour moi un choix s\u00fbr. Par contre, je dois dire que Raso\u00ef est dans une classe \u00e0 part du Cari Mela, c'est beaucoup plus de qualit\u00e9.\n\nEn entrant, vous pouvez d\u00e9j\u00e0 y voir une atmosph\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente.\n\nC'est fait pour \u00eatre plus zen. Ma banquette avait des petits coussins sur celle-ci, on ne trouve pas \u00e7a partout.\n\nLe menu est assez simple, mais offre beaucoup une dizaine de choix. Tous, sinon presque tous, les mets sont indiens. Il y a le grand classique du poulet au beurre et tandoori.\n\nNous avons commenc\u00e9 avec une entr\u00e9e, du fromage pan'eer enrob\u00e9 d'\u00e9pices indiennes avec une petite salade. S\u00e9rieux, prenez \u00e7a \u00e0 deux et \u00e7a sera malade dans votre bouche. C'est excellent.\n\nAu niveau du plat principal, j'y suis \u00e9t\u00e9 avec un classique poulet cari tikka qui vient avec un bol de riz et une salade. J'ai pris l'extra pain naan, car c'est tr\u00e8s bon \u00e0 manger pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas. Le plat \u00e9tait d\u00e9licieux. En terme de quantit\u00e9, j'ai du prendre un doggy bag \u00e0 la fin!\n\nMa copine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre une pizza suite aux conseils de la serveuse. \u00c7a fait bizarre prendre une pizza dans un restaurant indien. La p\u00e2te de pizza \u00e9tait... du pain naan! La pizza qu'elle a choisi \u00e9tait figues et pan'eer. C'\u00e9tait un go\u00fbt vraiment sp\u00e9cial et tr\u00e8s go\u00fbteux. Je vous avouerai qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de manger toutes les figues puisque c'est sucr\u00e9 un peu.\n\nMalheureusement, nous n'avions plus faim pour le dessert.\n\nJe recommande beaucoup. La facture avec deux verres de vins (la s\u00e9lection de bouteilles est quand m\u00eame grande) a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 77$.

This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!\n\nThere isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.\n\nIt didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! \n\nThe food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 \"Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink\" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the \"Caliente Burger Combo\" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a \"Chili Tamale\" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! \n\nAnybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories.

That was pretty much all that I needed to hear. It took just over a month after its opening but I headed down to the corner of Charlevoix and Notre-Dame (which at this point is probably my most visited street block in the city outside of the Jean Talon Market and my own apartment) with a friend for a little early weekend dinner.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you walk in is the visual differences between it and its brethren. No crazy or folksy paraphernalia on the walls. A very clean and elegant look with white brick, white tiles, wood tables and black leather. The entire right side of the narrow space is a beautiful bar where all the prep work is done. There is also a small relatively sparse terrasse in the back with communal tables. Overall, there is a sleeker look in keeping with a wine bar but once you add the blackboard menus and the alternative music, it keeps that Joe Beef/Liverpool House feel that I love.\n\nLike its brethren, Le Vin Papillon has no set menu on paper. When you enter, there is one blackboard with the day's menu listed as well as a couple that list the wine choices they have by the bottle. Surprisingly enough for a wine bar concept, they don't have very many selections by the glass. It is almost all by the bottle. The wines were mostly French and Italian from my browsing of the choices. The wines I tried were selected by our waiter because, to be honest, I have a complete lack of knowledge of wine outside of California so I figured he would be in a better place to provide me a good glass. Both were quite good but I won't go into details here. I'll stick to the food. \n\nThe menu is very interesting in that it is very light on meats which is really separates it from both other restaurants. The dishes are mainly vegetables based and are very much dishes design to accompany wine and share amongst your dining party.\n\nFirst up, we went with the haricots-coco-romano. Local quebec green beans with some prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, romano cheese and beans tossed in some olive oil. As will be a pretty consistent theme through the meal, this plate was a great showcase of local produce with a few augments to enhance and up the flavours. The sun-dried tomatoes and the romano were nice pairings with the crisp green beans. The olive oil allowed all the ingredients to blend nicely.\n\nWe followed that up with a selection of their cheeses of the day. Again, we left the choices up to the staff with the caveat of no blue cheese (still not a favorite of mine by itself). We got 3 out of the 7 they were offering that day. Great selection by the staff as they mixed up the texture and the tastes nicely. With the cheese, we got a plate of toasted artisan loaf bread with butter as well as fresh nuts to crack and enjoy. Loved the bread - thank god they didn't leave a basket at the table during the whole meal because I wouldn't have stopped eating it. As from the nuts, I love the idea but the practice of cracking them at the table is a little messier than is ideal. \n\nNext up, we went with the roasted onion and ricotta cheese. Just a great dish and a kind of item pairing that in hindsight I wished I had thought up sooner. Fresh creamy ricotta cheese with a beautifully roasted sweet onion and some more of that bread. Absolutely no complaints here.\n\nThe final dish of our first selection was the chicken wings with tarragon. Nice flavours here and the wings were cooked as they should be, however I feel this was the least successful dish but only because of the impractically of eating wings at a wine bar. A little too messy and sticky to enjoy with a glass of wine even when trying to eat them neatly.   \n\nStill somewhat hungry, we decided to order a couple of more plats. First up this time, their rotisserie Cauliflower. Yeah, that's right. This dish was by far the most unique thing we had this evening. Roasted cauliflower with thyme, crispy chicken skin, candied lemon peels and a spicy oil mixture on top. A surprisingly spicy dish but one with great texture and crunch from the roasted cauliflower and the chicken skin. Very enjoyable.\n\nWe then went with our waiter's suggestion of the vinegar eggplant. Roasted eggplants topped with a tomato/almond mixture, some melted cheese, some fresh basil and of course, as the name implies, vinegar. Nice earthy flavours throughout with the sweetness of the tomatoes, the richness of the cheese and the acidity of the vinegar mixed in. A surprisingly filling dish on top of all that. Very well done.\n\nTo finish the whole thing off, I went with a homemade chocolate truffle with some fresh blueberries. Rich creamy chocolate interior coated with some crushed pistachios for a little nutty crunch. Perfectly done and the perfect sweet touch to cap off the meal.\n\nOverall, a very nicely executed wine bar concept and one with a menu that surprises with its emphasis on vegetables. A few dishes and some wine glasses later, you leave stuffed and quite satisfied.", "business_id": "zV3OYfmA2L46dWiCMEZ6mg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2013-08-21", "length": 917, "open": 0}

I think all ramen burgers are gross not just this one.\n\nBut the rest of the stuff we ordered was amazing!!!\n\nwe had fried chicken wings, pork ribs, sisig, chicken and pulled pork tacos, pork steamed bun, and some rice dish i forgot the name...\n\nThe fried chicken wings are the best I've had in a while, they are fried and then caramelized in fish sauce. The fish sauce is very mild you don't smell it but it gives it a nice salty finish and makes it yummy wow!!!\n\nNext, the tacos, the chicken were fried a la KFC minus the bones, it had pickled carrots and daicon radish, it was so good. It was the same with the pulled pork. The taste is well balanced with sweet salty and tangy.\n\nThe pork bun was good, it had hoisin sauce, anything with hoisin is good. The bun was fresh and soft, but with all the other dishes we had, this one was lost in the mix.\n\nThe ribs were amazing, caramelized with sweet soy sauce, served on a bed of garlic mash potatoes. It went very well together. The ribs were tender a little on the sweet side but the mash counter very well with that. The sauce was so amazing I kept on putting it on my rice :)\n\nThe sisig is a hot sizzling plate of pork, and they crack an egg on it and mix it in. The eggy taste didn't really add anything to it I thought. It was a bit salty even with the egg, but it is served with white rice so that was fine.\n\nMy amazing find of the night was a rice dish, it was called Bicol express. It had coconut milk and shrimp paste in it. The rice came in a large bowl with some pork meat and long beans, on top is a spoon with hot sauce and shrimp paste that you mix in. Now shrimp paste is an acquired taste, but I love it. Overall I thought it was a bit toned down, I think it could use a bit more shrimp paste, it was too mild for me it needed more salt. The marriage of coconut milk and shrimp paste is heaven. It was delicious and fragrant, I've never had it before and I loved it. I think this was the most Philippine dish of the night aside from  sisig. next time i will ask for more shrimp paste though.\n\nIt was a great experience, for those of you who want to try something new this place is definitely a good find. Even though it's on victoria near Van Horne (metro plamondon), the place looks very trendy and clean not like the neighborhood wink wink. I think we are sorely lacking in Philippine cuisine and this is a gem. They have been opened only 7-8 months, and the place is not that packed yet, so go before you have to line up out the door!!!\n\nPrice wise it was about 25$ each with tons of food and a drink each, it could have been less if we hadn't ordered the 14$ ramen burger... It's sooo cheap for food this good :)\n\nSalamat ;)", "business_id": "9QE0tadSpX08BoqWShSe9A", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2013-12-18", "length": 676, "open": 0}

A place started by a chef who, turns out, sells bread to many of the best restaurants in the city - Joe Beef, Toqu\u00e9! and Nora Gray to name a few - something that I had never known and that completely blew my mind. The fact that all of these places look to Chef Jeff Finklestein for bread speaks volume about the quality of his product. His new bakery Hof Kelsten now allows us common folk to get a fresh loaf for ourselves.\n\nHof Kelsten is located just off the corner of Saint-Laurent and Mont Royal in what I recalled being an old super club Videotron which was confirmed when I noticed that the overnight return slot in still present with the sticker above it. There is no sign outside and the interior is relatively sparse - unfinished wood counters, a white tile wall, concrete floor and a few spot to sit down. The only indication of the name is the green fluorescent lights shaped into Hof Kelsten above the counter. Behind the bread wall, you can see the large kitchen where all the work is done.\n\nHof Kelsten offers a variety of bread and pastries with a few weekly specials such as Challah only available on Fridays. For my initial visit, I went with a loaf of their sourdough. Now I love sourdough bread - it is pretty much the only bread I eat when in the States as it is readily available there. I have never been able to find good sourdough to bring home here until now. This bread was great - beautiful crust, great flavour and perfect texture. I finally have sourdough bread in Montreal. Thank the heavens!\n\nFor the bread alone, I will be coming back quite often from here on out but there is even more. They also have a sandwich menu and a number of other items with a strong Jewish influence. Grabbing lunch, I went with the brisket sandwich with a half portion of Matzo ball soup and some latkes. The brisket is served warm with sliced apples, red cabbage and beet slaw with what appeared to be a homemade thousand island dressing all on the house rye. Just a wonderful sandwich. I never would have thought of apples and thousand island dressing with brisket but the combination works extremely well.\n\nThe Matzo soup was wonderful as well - great depth of flavour in the stock (and surprisingly not as salty as I expected), generous amount of chicken and vegetables in the soup and the matzo balls themselves were great. A perfect addition on a cold December as it was.\n\nThe last item was the latkes - quite large individually. Great crust on them while maintaining a nice texture inside. The surprising plus was the dipping sauce - a nice sweet addition that offset the lack of actual apple sauce to use instead (Note that I've always been a apple sauce over sour cream guy).\n\nAll in all, Hof Kelsten is a great bakery that lived up to all the praise I've heard and then some. The fact that I am only a quick bike or drive (or longish walk) away means that I have found my new \"neighbourhood\" bakery. Getting restaurant caliber bread on a weekly basis will be a beautiful thing and something that everyone near and far should run over for as quickly as they can.\n\nCheers!", "business_id": "26JE9TTLCyN0u55vum6pJg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2013-12-12", "length": 582, "open": 0}

I had an amazing opportunity to come to this festival with the VIP experience and it was worth the last minute drive.\n\nThe concept of having music, arts, learning, and FOOD all together in one is a great concept and congrats to the creators for putting together a solid show for the first year!\n\nWe got to explore a chef demonstration earlier in the day from Aaron Sanchez.  They had nice air conditioning and HD tvs inside the tents to enjoy the demonstration and they were giving away free chef hats. The Culinary Village was nothing I've ever seen at other music festivals. It was well organized with cute hipster decorations.  I never saw an extremely long line because they just had so many great quality vendors to choose from. \n\nOne of the highlights was the Recharge Retreat sponsored by Zappos. It was like a perfect party for a girl's night out. They offered complimentary 10 minute massages, a fun little braid bar, a photobooth, and open bar. A little part of me didn't want to leave but I had to check out the bands. There were vendors and booths throughout the area with big hearts and cool street art.  They really revamped downtown Las Vegas which was in need of a desperate makeover. \n\nAll the music artists put on a solid show with no disruptions. The VIP area had a little seating area by the bar and was sectioned off to the front side.  I wish I was able to stay Sunday night with a stronger lineup.

Harajuku Kitchen is a beautiful and ungimmicked Japanese restaurant more interested in a good dining experience than being a food theme park. In a delightful pale pink bomb of East Meets West, it fuses soft candlelight, gentle jazz, wooden flooring and chopsticks to create a relaxing and extremely enjoyable mealtime. Harajuku is the area of Tokyo best known for its funky street style subcultures such as Lolita, but the eponymous Kitchen is far more subtle in its decor.\n\nKaori is a wonderfully cheerful hostess, seemingly thrilled with her establishment (rightly). The first time I came I was able to work by the window using the free wifi (mega Cressi bonus points) as the tea came in abundance. More recently, I came here with Moray L for lunch on a torrentially rainy day. Inside, it was peaceful and oh so warm. We could feel cosy, forgetting the world outside.\n\nOh and the food! It's all very well having a beautiful and comfortable little place (little is the word!) but if the food don't cut the mustard then kind words won't butter no parsnips and... I'm mixing my analogies... In a foodie confusion caused by the joy of this meal. My tonkatsu was amazing - a goodly portion of delicious, tender pork and flavoursome rice of just the right stickiness to handle easily with chopsticks. The value is very good too; most dishes are under a tenner and if they're all as good as mine (Moray's chicken was to die for too) then you really can't go wrong.\n\nI'm just glad I don't live in Bruntsfield or I would never have any money.

I was all excited, the decor is cute, the staff is friendly, the music is great, the menu is diverse, the prices are reasonable (or so I thought)..but then I got my food..\n\nNow, let me start by saying that I do understand that quality and quantity do not ever need to have anything to do with each other.  But given that the quality of this dish was not compensating for the UTTER lack of quantity, it made me a sad Necie.  I ordered mine to-go, and upon getting home and excitedly opening up the box, I stared at it for a minute, wondering if there was a mix-up..Was there some poor child that now had to wait for their order since it was accidentally given to me?  I'm not model thin, and I do have an appetite, but the portioning on this dish was out of whack compared to what was charged ($10.54).  There's a picture of the exact dish I ordered in the same to-go box situation as mine in another review to show that I'm not crazy!  Like, just to be clear, there's NOT another layer of noodles underneath that which is visible in that picture.  And that to-go box is NOT huge.  In fact, they probably should just use Chinese food to go boxes as they'd waste less space.  \n\nHere's the deal, was the sauce yummy?  Yeah.  Was the chicken yummy?  Yeah.  Was the flavor profile overall a good idea in practice?  Yeah.  But if you are going to put together a fairly simple dish, don't skimp on the pasta!  Had there been 1/3-twice more pasta, I wouldn't have written this review.  I'd have wondered why there were 5 tiny pieces of chicken lost amongst the rest of the delicious sauce and noodles, but I wouldn't have felt completely jipped.  Or had this dish been priced around $6.50, I would have accepted the portioning.  This all really disappoints me as there were a few other dishes I wanted to try after reading through the entire menu, but at this point, unless someone ELSE is buying (and that someone else has a small appetite), I won't be going back (unless they adjust their portioning).  The only reason I gave this 3 stars was due to the fact that the food was pretty good..just not good enough to justify the cost.", "business_id": "6OJV--BjqPpJjnTueniqVw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 1, "date": "2013-11-07", "length": 436, "open": 0}

I can't speak for the eggplant based dishes because I am not an eggplant fan, however everyone else loved them.\n\nThe main dishes we had varied from different plates of foul (Egyptian style fava beans) to eggs with egyptian pastrami, and egyptian falafel. Again, we were all very impressed and definitely made it a point to taste every dish on the table.\n\nAfter having some tea and dessert we asked for the bill to be split evenly amongst us (6 people) and were super surprised to find out that we only owed $18 per person....After all those appetizers, main dishes, dessert, tea, and 9 (yes, NINE) cans of pop, we only had to pay $18 each??? \n\nNot only was the food great and the prices even greater, but the restaurant itself has a charming vibe with great decor, pictures of iconic actors and singers on the walls, authentic furniture shipped in from Egypt, Egyptian music, and even Egyptian TV. \n\nAll in all, 5 stars. For those of you looking for good, cheap, authentic Egyptian food, make sure to pop in here! And while you're at it, make sure to say hello to the super friendly Albert (the young entrepreneur who owns this restaurant).

I was so stoked and thought to myself \"this is just what I need to get better!\" The next day as I was feeling better I met a friend to grab a juice and check the place out. FYI: They have another location 2 blocks away where they make the cold pressed juice and they have a runner that shuttles over Flavors they don't have in the cooler, so make sure you don't make this mistake. Even if you do it's walking distance so no big. \n\nAfter we found it we oohed and aahed at the awesome building and colors. I especially love the logo design. The two people behind the counter were really helpful. They explained the cold press process and what other bevys and snacks you could get there. I opted for Anton's spinach and it was deeeeelicious! Highly recommend this. Also, on the table inside they had a cute baking sheet of some goodies cut up for sampling. There is a small bar and a larger communal table for seating.

I usually am on top of the new restaurants that are opening in the area, but somehow this one got by me. Wifey spotted it the other day and we decided to check it out yesterday. It just opened on Tuesday, so it was perfect timing. The location is great, it's located right next to Postino on Central. The decor is done awesome, very urban but warm if that makes sense. The restaurant was very busy but seemed to run like a well oiled machine. We were seated pretty quick, they have a nice patio and tons of indoor/bar dining options. We started with a few cocktails, traditional margarita and I went with the blood orange margarita. Wifey wasn't over the moon about her traditional margarita, was a bit flat but my  blood orange margarita was great. they have a well rounded menu with tacos, tamales, tortas, burritos and a few specials. They also have a short list of apps/shareable plates. we started with the guacamole, which was done perfect. I opted for 3 tacos: Fried fish, braised beef and this spicy chicken. They were all great, my fave being the  braised beef. I also got the Mexican street corn, which was delicious. Wifey got the Chilaquiles, and LOVED her dish.

From the service to the cute decor and.. The food! Omg the food. So good! Was not expecting the different types of flavors and dishes that this place had to offer. Definitely not your typical Vietnamese restaurant that you find in china town. I want to say it's more of an Asain fusion with a primary focus on Vietnamese style cooking/flavors. My group and I ended up ordering family style which I felt was the best way to try more of the dishes because the menu had so many options to offer! Everything sounded so tasty! \n\nThere wasn't a single dish that we didn't enjoy, but I highly recommend the shaken beef salad, pork belly with boiled egg, beef tacos (my favorite!! Not on the menu), steak and eggs and Ox tail pho. Hands down best pho I've ever had. I usually have to add hoisen sauce to enhance the flavor but this was perfect the way it came.

Keep in mind that adding options will probably increase the meal cost while reducing or removing options will likely keep the price the same.\nThe tablets have a Call Server button in the upper right hand corner that will bring your attendant over.\nAll food and drinks are brought to you by the server.\n\nFOOD\nWe had the BLT wrap, krayvings veggie wrap, and breakfast bacon, egg, rice wrap.  Each wrap also had a small green salad with dressing included.  All very tasty and fresh.  Salads were crisp and crunchy with slightly sweet and tangy dressing.  \nFinal bill came out to around $24, including tax, but not tip.\nFood is served on brown butcher paper on an aluminum plate.  Flatware and drinking cups are all ECO product plastic, made from plants and bio-degradable & compostable.\n\nCUSTOMER RECOMMENDATIONS\nEnjoy browsing through the tablet menu.  Krayvings has many different dishes with a wide variety of customization options.  Take time to enjoy the atmosphere and food.\n\nRESTARUANT RECOMMENDATIONS\nPlace label stickers on tablets similar to ones on tables to simplify matching tablets to tables.  The tablet at our table didn't work initially so we swapped tablets with a different table; making things confusing because we would receive orders for tables that probably had the tablet linked to our physical table.\n\nWait for all the orders at one table to be finished before bringing the bills.  Because we had two separate orders, there was some confusion on what our total bill would be.  I can see customers potential taking advantage of this by making multiple orders, but only paying for one bill.\n\nThere isn't any direct feedback about whether your server has gotten the Call Servers notification because most of the servers were waiting by the kitchen and drinks to bring out food.  One option is to give small vibrating pagers to each server, that when someone presses the Call Server button, the table number pops up on the pager.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nKrayvings is likely to rapidly rise in popularity due to its convenient location between the 215 loop, Red Rock Casino, and Red Rock Canyon.  The food is delicious and healthy.  They will likely overcome the slight tricks with launch and use of tablets for ordering.  My wife and I are likely to eat there again as we enjoy going hiking in Red Rock Canyon and taking friends to new places to eat.", "business_id": "jgkT9RA3OCBqgniWCkwLrA", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 1, "date": "2014-03-14", "length": 535, "open": 1}

Mother Bunch time, that is.  \n\nPark along the generous neighboring streets, get lucky with a spot in the adorably small parking lot, or lock your bike in the convenient rack directly in front of the door.  When you enter, you'll be greeted by a contagiously happy host who'll ask for your seating preference (bar or table), and direct you that way with magnetic enthusiasm.  I chose to sit at the bar, which was a fabulous decision, though by the looks of the tables and booths, you really can't go wrong.  When I was walking back to the restroom (which there are two of, they're unisex and private.  Nice.), I noticed some beautiful church pews that served has booths, and learned that they were from an old church in Tucson. Very nice touch.  \n\nThe bar is the centerpiece of this brightly lit establishment, and they've taken great care to make it comfortable and beautiful.  I was immediately impressed by the counter top, which seems to be a granite/concrete mixture with dazzling color in its unique finish.  There's a large blackboard on the wall that dons all of the beer choices, which is easy to read and visually appealing.  If you're in the mood for a mixed drink, there are plenty of choices as they have a full bar (though I glossed right over that and focused on the brews).  \n\nMy sister and I were shocked that we were able to talk to each other using our inside voices, despite the packed house and classic rock playing in the background.  Must be those magical 1926 acoustics.  \n\nIt's going to take a minute before they're able to start pouring their own house brews, but they have wisely chosen some great local and craft beers that'll entice a wide variety of taste buds.  My bartender, James, was knowledgeable and eager to please when it came to choosing the best and the brightest.  The Borderlands Citrana Wild Ale is now a favorite, and I had no idea they were making this lovely liquid in Tucson.  Nice.  \n\nTHE FOOD!  The food.  The menu is simple in design, but complex in its variation.  I chose the vodka citrus cured salmon, and my sister got the steak (sliced prime rib).  We were so pleasantly surprised to see the use of pickled fennel throughout the menu, which you don't see many places, if any!  If you haven't had pickled fennel, get'chu some pickled fennel.   The house made sauce that came with the steak was an absolute treat, and definitely stood out.  But the mashed potatoes were just fantastic.  Smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned.  Our one complaint was that we wanted more, like piles more.  Mountains.  The cured salmon was buttery and balanced beautifully.  It was such a surprise to see it as an option on a bar menu, and I'm so glad I chose it.  It came with some crispy bread, capers, onions, a creamy goat cheese spread, and that lovely pickled fennel.  I loved it, loved it.  \n\nThe prices reflect the quality and creativity in the menu, so it's not your $5 burger and fries place.  I did notice quite a few orders of their home made pork rinds, which were so crispy, you could hear people bite into them from across the room!  You could probably order a couple of those, a few beers, and pat your belly in happiness.  They're probably going to be a happy hour favorite, I'm guessing.\n\nThis is a wordy review, but I'm not going to apologize.  I'm so excited that this place exists, and I'm very proud of the owner, Julie, (who was walking around talking to patrons and seemed to be beaming with well deserved pride).  William Hampton is the head brewer, and he has a lot of fun work ahead of him with some fantastic equipment.  I can't wait to taste his first lineup, which includes a hearty oatmeal stout, and some creative small batch concoctions.  \n\nDowntown is a lucky sonofabitch to have Mother Bunch.

Beginning first with a few bites of chicken - a trio of karaage, 'bourban,' and orange - I was immediately impressed by the crunchy sapor of the first while the last was a touch too sweet and moving next through a basket of juicy shumai my attention turned to the 'truck,' my first Fukuburger moist and rich even before being gilded with a slightly overcooked egg and punchy accoutrements. Rarely impressed by potatoes but finding the crispy 'jazz' fries quite addicting as I chatted with the team about the upcoming \"art, music, and entertainment\" it was just prior to noon when my final plate arrived and with both duck and pork crispy yet supple beneath a touch of acid-sweet sauce I immediately swooned, a $12 plate worth the drive from Spring Mountain to The Strip as opposed to the other way around.", "business_id": "bdsKG7MQIMmZ73lgOaTZ0A", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-05-26", "length": 363, "open": 1}

I will come back in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. But first, let me praise the staff to the high heavens. Unlike a lot of new places downtown they don't assume you're going to just drink the koolaid. They were ernest in their desire to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our food. They seemed to have actually tasted most of the food and had good recommendations for us. Much like La Comida, I'd eat here again regardless of what I thought of the food because the staff made the experience worthwhile. Fyi, I don't care for the food at La Comida. \n\nThe food. Well. We split oxtail risotto which, honestly, was so rich as to be offputting. I ate maybe four spoonfuls as did my lunch date. There was plenty left to take home but we passed. We also had the bacon jam with brie. It was actually delish, but again, a little went a long way. A very long way. Again, we passed on taking the extra home. The empanadas were filled with nice chunky meat that was tender though it could've been a tad juicier. The mushroom flatbread was a great appetizer and the pizza cook was lots of fun without being overly familiar.\n\nHere's my issue and it's something you can actually see in the accompanying picture. The risotto and jam seemed to be swimming in something. It wasn't grease. Maybe some oil like truffle? The lake of whatever it was did not inspire one to want to deal with that in a to go box or when it inevitably congealed. Again, offputting is the only word I can find to describe my feelings about it. It really wasn't greasy or slimy, but it looks that way. Combined with the fact that everything (except the empanadas) was just way too rich means I won't be pushing this as a place to go. Not yet. \n\nI'm sure that Carson Kitchen will find it's feet very soon, and hope so. I like the vibe even if the decor looks like someone went to EAT and decided that's the new downtown Vegas hip eatery look. Seriously, it almost looks like a blatant rip off. They seemed to be working on an outside patio which in and of itself will get me back this summer. And, not to be petty, I give it points for being filled with adults, not a bunch of bearded wannabes. \n\nThe pricing seemed a tad ambitious. For small plates you can go from a quick bite to a $50 lunch in no time. Not outrageous but probably not in my, \"let's run by for a nosh\", price range.\n\nI look forward to sampling more of Carson Kitchen soon but I'm hoping they bring the ooze down a notch.

You feel as though you are having a drink at a friend's loft. But you can rest assured, an intimate experience is on the menu. \nThe most enjoyable, of course, are the drinks. I ordered the Chia Fresca and it was love at first sip. It was amazingly refreshing. The mix of coconut water, cucumber, and gin brought me to heaven. Thankfully, you can order a pitcher of this amazingness. \nSince the bar has recently opened, I expect more people to learn about this gem on the outskirts of Chinatown.

There are a few made with other spirits, but not many. I tried the Delirium something, I've forgotten the full name, but it's bourbon based and is served in part of an old water gun, cute!

I so very much wanted to enjoy this place. It's always an amazing day when you find that a fairly pretentious coffee house is being replaced with something a lot less so! The restaurant is literally across the road from my work and would be an excellent Friday treat for myself and the rest of the office.\n\nThe decor is typical of a lot of places these days - exposed brickwork, unpainted woodwork, hodge-podge furniture etc. And the staff were very accommodating and friendly. All very much a positive, imo.\n\nThere were 4 of us in our party and the 3 guys all opted for the cheese burger, and 2 of them had fries on the side, and I being veggie, had the 1 option on the menu - the Magic Mushroom Burger. All burgers cost the same amount: \u00a37.50 and this is where things get a bit....erm...meh....\n\nThe food arrived around 30 minutes after we sat down. We were all presented with greaseproof paper mats, on top of which came our paper-wrapped burgers. Call me old fashioned, but I like plates or boards to eat off of! This is essentially fast food at gourmet prices. My \u00a37.50 got me a brioche bun with a mildly spicy bean patty, a mushroom, a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, a bit of salad and a mildly spicy salsa. It's important to note that all sides are separate. I remember looking enviously at the gherkins which the guys seemed to have and thinking that just a bit of 'pep' might have changed my entire experience. There's a common misconception that veggie sometimes means bland. Maybe the introduction of some spicy condiments might help out here. I felt a little short-changed, if I'm honest. The Southern, for example, offers a multiple choice of veggie options and comes with a side of fries and a side of slaw for around 50p more. \n\nI really don't want this to be a damning review, after all the 3 guys who I was with absolutely loved their meals, but I just came away feeling that the vegetarian option was simply tacked on to appease folk like me. I will go back as my better half wants to check it out, but I think the next time I really want a burger, I will go to the Southern or Wanaburger and get a hell of a lot more bang for my buck, both in terms of value and actual sustenance.", "business_id": "EYpqqsJZ3L2EFAPK-NEOFA", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 1, "date": "2014-07-15", "length": 447, "open": 0}

So, when we booked our room for SLS, we knew Umami was definitely going to be one of our meals!\n\nThis location inside the SLS is quite large. Not only is it a full service restaurant, but it's also houses the casinos sports book and a beer garden. There's quite a bit of seating throughout the location, but the way it's set up is weird and there seems to be no real uniformity. Alongside seating at the indoor bar, there's small tables, high-tops, and couches for the sports book. Then when you walk outside, you've got more picnic table style seating, and another fairly large bar that's got to be a good 50+ feet long. There's just a lot going on and depending on where you sit, you may not be able to order food or just sit down to enjoy a drink while watching the games. If you are coming strictly for the food though, they do offer text notifications so you can go gamble or do whatever while waiting for a table.\n\nLooking online, it seems like the menu is pretty much the same as at other locations, and there's a good amount of options too. If you're not feeling a burger, they have salads, \"Un-Beef\" sandwiches and even sausages. The sides are pretty typical for a burger joint and the fries can be customized in a handful of ways. There's 8 burgers to choose from and this Umami is no different from the others as their infamous no substitution rule is in full-effect. Although, they will let you request a different cooking temperature for the meat. Standard cooking temp is medium rare, just so ya know.\n\nWe decided on an order of fried pickles to share, and I opted for the Truffle Especiale burger. Oddly enough, after receiving the order, our waitress told us that she wasn't a huge fan of the fried pickles. I couldn't disagree with her more as they were definitely some of the better I've had. The batter was thick, crunchy, flavorful and stuck to the pickle completely. It never fell apart and I liked that the pickle inside wasn't so hot that you couldn't eat it. Adding to the flavor was a nice side of jalapeno ranch that was creamy with just a touch of heat.\n\nAlthough a bit on the small side, my burger was equally impressive. If you're a fan of truffle, Umami does not disappoint! Topped with both truffle butter and truffle arugula, the flavor is immediately present without being overpowering. The arugula still had a nice crisp texture to it, and it coupled perfectly with the fried egg. Now, these guys are proud of their beef too...and rightfully so! The meat isn't smashed down like meatloaf and on it's own has hints of both sweet and salty flavors. It was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. \n\nWith all the commotion going around on their first day, I admittedly expected less than stellar service. That was far from the case and I thought the service was excellent. Apart from her expressing her hatred for the fried pickles, after we ordered them, our waitress was extremely friendly and even a little funny too. I appreciate that she knew the menu well and didn't hesitate to answer a single question. And not only was she on her game, but other servers were checking on us and every other table to make sure drinks were full, etc. The team work and overall ambience was just great!\n\nFor a burger joint, the overall prices aren't horrible, but they aren't great either. My burger was $14 and even though I think this was more of a casino thing, I was pretty irritated about paying $5 for a soda. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a side, our bill was $55 with tip. I'm also not a huge fan of having all that stuff packed into one location. But the food and service were both very good and I definitely see myself coming back!", "business_id": "WzDvQdS7MQrWK7vyDjdR4Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2014-08-24", "length": 730, "open": 0}

With that said, all the gym rats and fitness minded folks with goals of obtaining or maintaining their six-packs, you do not have to avoid the SLS Buffet... on your cheat day.\n\nThe rest of the people that are normal (even extra normal) and more well rounded (pun intended) in the waistline department, come as often as you like (Note: You can earn 2 complimentary SLS Buffet passes with 500 slot points).  Having a few meals here will definitely help you maintain your corpulent rotundness, making you just that much more beloved by Jenny Craig. \n\nSo I know I been watching what I eat recently. So if it wasn't for the SLS grand opening and the \"obsession?\" to check out new places and leave a trail blazer report for the rest of the Yelp Pals, my better judgement would have grounded me and kept me on my granola with dried blueberries diet.  But I suck at being rational when it comes to food and women. So here I am at home now, writing my review.\n\nFirst of all, SLS being the latest casino property to open to the general public in LV (as of Aug 23, 2014), with nice modern facelift to update what used to be the Sahara, of course has a modern looking buffet.  It is not huge or fancy like Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it is still way better than the one at the Palms.  On opening weekend, the dinner is $40.  So it is not cheap. But still in the same ballpark as the rest of the also ran buffet contenders.\n\nThe dining area and also the serving stations look pretty good.  The decorations seems (okay, not gonna sugar coat it), is half complete for the serving stations.  The shelves above is only decorated on about 60% of the buffet (Asian dim sum section to just past the mid point (carving station). Not sure if it was a budget thing, or not getting in all the decorations elements (enameled cast iron cookware), but the bulk of the decoration is noticeably lopsided. Not a big thing, and will not affect the quality of the food served, but it is just one of those attention to details thing.  The seats and tables in the dining area is comfortable and spaced well, so you do not feel cramped or boxed in (Good job!).\n\nThe buffet has the usual snow crab legs, some fresh clams, cooked shrimp, prime rib carving station (prime rib was good), dessert station (it is a large island of baked goods, not too much variety though, with some special highlights I will discuss later), a large Asian & dim sum section.  But overall I was not really impressed.  No serious WOW factor. But it is not terrible either.  Pretty A-Okay,with definite room for easy & significant improvements.\n\nLet me cover what I do like about this buffet.\n\n* Layout of the savory stations is straight forward. No lines per say to wait, just go in for the prize, wherever you see what caught your gleaming eyes.\n* Plenty of large plates on the bottom shelf for you to pick up and pile on your build your own feast.\n* Small portions available for self service, which is refreshed with newer back ups. So you get fairly fresh dishes throughout your meal.\n* The line was very short. Hardly any wait, but you do have to look for the buffet or wonder successfully to this part of the SLS property.\n\n* Fresh fried doughnuts tossed in cinnamon sugar. [Highlight of the meal]\n\n* Dried Blueberries [Not sure what you would eat this with, but I was happy to just snack on these plain]\n* Sushi was fresh.\n* Pastas are all good.\n* Gelato was tasty & serving was generous (compared to all the buffets I tried further south of SLS).\n\nCould be better:\n\n* Crepe maker's skill is really at the novice of novice level.  I think he is dreading it, and it shows in the final odd shaped product. The batter is spread thin and overcooked in sections, while thick and under-cooked in others.\n* Crepe station ingredients are not stored properly for service or needs to be reformulated. (Chocolate and Nutella are so thick you can't portion it let alone make designs with them. Mixing it with 10% oil or holding it at higher temperature (melting point) would make more sense.\n* Dim Sum section has great variety but sometimes you just like a lot of shumai (just an example). So should I leave with 3 bamboo steaming baskets or just consolidate right there.\n* Dim sum portions for some items seems too big (chicken feet, the steam buns), I know I opted out, since I don't want to waste food.\n* Steamed Basmati rice was dried and crusty. Maybe smaller portions is better or have a cover for it.\n* Dessert selections is fairly limited. It looks full, but the same desserts are scattered on almost all sides of the large dessert island.\n\nFor $40 (weekend dinner) I thought it was okay, and worth checking out for the sake of checking it out (even some SLS employees agreed).  $30 is a no brainer. $35 is a toss up. 3 stars!", "business_id": "-j68F3i6vq1K7Fj9HuncHQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-08-23", "length": 911, "open": 1}

They are still working out the kinks but what I experienced today was promising. \n\nThe baristas are incredibly friendly and helpful, even with the crazy crowd they had to contend with today. The cappuccino is delicious, but the iced coffee with caramel syrup was a little too sweet for my liking.  The prices are not the cheapest but the convenience makes up for it, especially if you are staying or playing in the property.\n\nThe only thing that made me impatient is that I ordered the only remaining passion banana croissant in the display case. Being tired (hence the desperate need of caffeine), I just assumed that I will be getting it with my coffees but it turned out that they still have to be prepared in the back. I was perplexed since it was just in the case so why could I not just have that? Ordinarily, I would not mind but if I knew I had to wait, I would have skipped the croissant during this visit. And after 20 minutes of waiting, it turned out that they no longer have it so I had to fall in line again to get a refund.\n\nI am sure that once the kinks have been worked out, I would like them more.

The decor is simple, crisp, classic French bistro and the music is the perfect level and balance. I found the restaurant was roughly 3/4 full, it seats roughly 30 not including the bar. Service was efficient and pleasant, moving on...\nI purposely chose to not show the menu due to the fact it is a seasonal menu and will rotate from time to time.

Basically the first ones there, the empty restaurant eventually filled up as we made our way through much of the menu together.  Because we shared, it was a good way to taste a bit of each dish.\n\nWe had:  Cheesy Garlic Toast, Bacon Cheddar Biscuits, Pimento Cheese, Smokey Bleu Cheese Fondue, Black Mission Figs, Bacon & Eggs, Baked Artichokes, Breakfast Poutine, Dirty Mac N Cheese, Chopped Chicken Liver, Butcher Style Chicken Wings,  and all three of the desserts, Bag of Donut Holes, Banana Pudding, and the Loaded S'mores Nachos.  14 dishes, with 2 orders of each one, came to $231 and change.\n\nHighlights for me:\nI loved the biscuits--the honey salt butter accompanying them is wonderful.  I must get my own order next time because I only had a small piece since we were sharing.\nI am also a fan of the pimento cheese, something I haven't had since I was a little girl in the Dark Ages.  This is a generous serving, literally a jar of pimento, so when you run out of crackers and pretzel chips, just ask the friendly servers for more.   I ate a lot of this! \nThe mac n cheese with burnt pork ends is a good version that I'd have again, as well as the figs with goat cheese, pistachio, and pomegranate seeds.  Of the three desserts, I liked the donuts the best, but that's only because I'm not a big fan of the other two desserts offered, in general.

There was a crowd of people (hundreds) milling around and also on the skating rink. We wanted some coffee and a baked good to nibble on while we watched the skating on the ice rink. We were denied because they were closed (closing), others were also turned away. It was a Friday night, it was First Friday, the ice rink was open until 11 and they close at 7. How sad is that. sorry but I can't patronize a restaurant that closes ridiculously early on a Weekend Night especially when there is activity going on in Downtown Phoenix. That left our only choice Starbucks which has old high calorie baked goods and frankly not the best coffee to my taste. Actually no coffee place in Phoenix is open at 7 p.m. except Starbucks. So The Corner should take advantage of this and stay open.

Welcome to Edinburgh El Cartel, the likes of you has been sorely missed.\n\nMexican food in the UK is often thought of as \"take one tortilla, stuff it with a meat, stuff the rest of the space with cheese, pan-fry / deep fry / bake / leave as is, and serve with guac, salsa and sour cream. Rinse and repeat.\" I was always perplexed by the fact that an entire menu could be made of burritos, fajitas, chimichangas, tacos - and all these things were the same ingredients served in slightly different ways. And all of them were stody, heavy, flavoured with one spice, and not remotely Mexican.\n\nAnyway, that's enough of what El Cartel is not. What El Cartel is, is a breath of fresh air to the Mexican, and general dining, scene in Edinburgh. A one-side A5 menu that has about 5 small plates, then 5 taco options. And that's it. But trust me, that's all you need given how tasty and varied the options are.\n\nThe chorizo and plantain fritters were just a taste bomb in my mouth (taste bomb of goodness). The steak tacos, oh my. Black taco, fresh, with slices of freshly griddled steak still pink in the middles, with just the right amount of dressing and cheese to not overpower it. I'd say with two starters to share amongst three, and two tacos each, it was actually a really good feed -- and cheap too!\n\nThe blueberry frozen margarita to wind it all up was stroooonnnng but also good (I love tequila).\n\nI can see El Cartel becoming one of my favourite new eateries in Edinburgh. It's no secret or surprise that the minds behind the Bon Vivant and Devil's Advocate can do no wrong -- and this newest little brother restaurant is testament to that.

I clocked the portion size for the starter and was surprised at the price point. The deep fried cheese starter was tiny.

The next 2 were inedible due to them having no cheese in them and all you are eating is burnt batter.....urrrghh! We both had the same experience. For \u00a34.50 each we expected a little better.

And the manager, Todd made sure that everything was perfect. He even gave a hug to my husband and I.  I'm so glad that he put everything into this establishment. It shows.  It's rare for me to give a perfect rating, but its a honest and accurate rating. \n\nParking: its not the best, but its free parking and ample amount.

With Allegheny Wine Mixer a few doors down, I could theoretically not go out for drinks anywhere else but this one block for months and be quite happy! (I'm easily pleased, I know.) As soon as my boyfriend alerted me to the presence of a new beer drinking establishment we decided to check it out that very night, and we were so glad we did. \n\nAs soon as we walked in I noticed that the atmosphere was homey and comfortable overall, with wood paneling, a mix of wooden bar stools and high top tables, a chalkboard with the draft list, and an assortment of vintage farming tools hung on the walls. It was enough to create a down-home and casual vibe but not so much that it was off-putting or overly snobbish. (I hate receiving shade because my hair is clean and I'm a happy carnivore.) \n\nIn addition to the atmosphere, I really appreciated the bartender who was very friendly and took the time to ask us what beers we typically drank before offering us suggestions. We ended up going with his recommendation of Rye Rebellion, a potent little imperial stout aged in Four Roses whiskey barrels, and it was an excellent choice! I didn't feel like I was being pressured by him into drinking some arbitrary favorite beer of his, which was the nicest part honestly. As someone who knows her beer and whiskey, it can be incredibly frustrating having a male bartender treat me like a Bud Light girl haha. None of that at Full Pint thankfully!

We randomly stumbled upon it after our post dinner (pusadee's garden) walk.  We were feeling adventurous and thirsty and decided to wander in.  It's an old Moose Lodge- which makes for some interesting furnishings and a disco ball in the middle of the room- it's got a very charming dive/lodge feel.  Through the kitchen and in the back of the Lodge is a place to chill, play horseshoes or others enjoy your beverages outdoors.  The crowd was a mixed bag- but the average age seemed 20 something.  We were definitely on the oldest folks in the bar.  \nThe drinks are great- no crazy tender bar concoctions but fresh juices for mixers and plenty of beer on draft.  \nMy favorite drink of the evening was gin and juice-included gin, carrot juice, ginger.  I also got the Laura Palmer - a fabulous bourbon drink!  They have baby Budwiser cans for $1.  \nOn Sunday nights (we were there on a Sunday evening) they play Bingo (aka Bingo Bango) for a chance to win pizza or a drink.  It's a silly, fun way to kill some time.  We won and got a piece of pizza (yes, I know we already ate dinner thank you.) and it was yummilicious!  They end Bingo Bango before 9 because they show Game of Thrones.  It seems like it's a mixed bag as to whether folks want to watch or not.  Seems like the staff isn't so much on GoT.  The reason I mention this is that if you come here to watch it can be annoying with all of the other convos from folks not into it.  But no big for us.  \nThe staff is young and friendly.  The only opportunity for improvement is that the one bartender forgot our order 2 times- so we had to remind her.  I heard her apologize to other folks for forgetting- might have just been a 'one of those days.'

As Siegel's 1941 has only recently opened, there are bound to be a few kinks but the restaurant is a solid place to eat.  The restaurant has been completely renovated from when it was the steakhouse for the El Cortez.  I was sorry to see that go, but I was happy to see what they did for a replacement.  While more open and more open to the casino than the former steakhouse, I'm glad to see how they've given honors to Benjamin Siegel for when he had partial ownership of the El Cortez.  Also prominent in the decorations are photos of his girlfriend Virginia Hill.\n\nNow the food.  The restaurant did a better job with the savory dishes than the sweet breakfast ones.  The Cuban, Monte Cristo, corned beef hash, and chicken pot pie were the standouts of the savory items.  The chicken and waffle was good as was the French toast.  The chocolate Nutella pancakes were a disappointment.  I expected something more than sloshing on some Nutella on top of pancakes.  \n\nThere were a few glitches in the kitchen.  We ordered eggplant parmigiana but got chicken parmigiana.  We also ordered just meatballs but we got spaghetti and meatballs.  These are the issue which need to be worked out.\n\nOur server, Claudia, did an outstanding job.  She almost singlehandedly served the food to this hungry foursome.  \n\nI'd return for the corned beef hash if for breakfast and I will definitely return for the chicken pot pie.

Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly. \n\nThough no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me. \n\n$2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast. \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood.", "business_id": "DL5AAHTwUeWCOR1e-UvIzQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2015-09-25", "length": 160, "open": 0}

My husband and I are Las Vegas locals and like to spend a date night on the strip every so often. Skyfall lounge is one of our favorite spots. The drinks are great and the food is delicious. The scenery is gorgeous and the decor is very modern and sleek. The staff is dressed in a professional yet modern/casual style and are all very well trained. We were really impressed at how well-mannered everyone was. They treat you like high class but are friendly and genuine and it doesn't feel \"stuffy\". (We've been to some places that make you feel like you can't afford to be there or like you are dumb and don't know the fancy lingo. They were all very easy going and vibed with our table. very professional and knowledgeable) The signature mixed drinks are very unique and well made. We had some sliders and they were amazing. After the lounge we had dinner in the rivea restaurant. Our waiter was Mike and he was great. He was like-able and social and attentive. All the staff who delivered the wine/food/bussed tables were professional and friendly. Our food was just incredible.  We loved the mushroom risotto, and the octopus salad. My husband ordered the filet Mignon and I had the lobster. Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. This place is a fun experience. I felt fancy and important with a welcoming staff and a great environment.", "business_id": "MslRyQrfX9bgPqbNZXoPEA", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2015-09-29", "length": 251, "open": 0}

Tables, lounge areas, etc. are near the dance area. (Oh, wait. Is there a dance area? In effect, you dance wherever.)\n* Diverse menu with different items.\n* Friendly staff. They add to the warmth of the place with their smiles and willingness to chat a bit.\n* The music. I liked what I heard when I was there. Danceable and yet not intrusive if you are chilling with friends in the lounge area. Not sure if the music is always this way.\n\nTHE BADS:\n* The service. They are so busy being friendly, you can forget service. I went in twice when they were slow (maybe 10 people in the place) and eventually left each time without being served. The second time I even pointedly said to the (apparent) server, \"I want to be served by you.\" Sure!\" she responded, and I ended up with menus. 20 minutes later, no one had come to take the order. \n* Drinks and food looked good by menu descriptions, but I can't tell you whether they were any good.  See point above.\n* If you want a discreet space for chatting with friends, forget it if there is dancing or a crowd. What can be intimate (the whole place as dance) can also be off-putting if you are looking to lounge.\n* The \"LOVE\" sign. It's a good fit artistically for the place, but too bright. At night it shines on the front third of the place like a spotlight. I'd suggest lower wattage bulbs that create a glow.\n\nTHE CONCLUSION:\nTwo times with no service, a month into operations? There are lots of other places to check out. Maybe I'll check in again in a year.", "business_id": "OgsDmWHsTAjiaGjl49o-Gw", "second": 1, "vegas": 0, "stars": 1, "menu": 1, "date": "2015-11-07", "length": 308, "open": 0}

We attended a pre-opening event the Friday before their planned Sunday public opening. They said there were a few furniture items yet to arrive, so they will continue to enhance the decor.\n\nThe cocktail list is diverse and impressive. The menu includes pictures of the drinks, which I thought was a nice touch and practical. I love bubbly cocktails and quickly gravitated to theirs. They also premix a tiki drink and one other and have them kegged. We shared samples of both and they were excellent. The tiki drink is a great throwback to the mid 20th century cocktail party vibe.\n\nThe food we sampled at different stations throughout the night was excellent. They make their own hummus, chicken pate and wonderful bread, including a pretzel bread. I was particularly fond of the hummus and the lightly pickled vegetables for the bahn mi. Throughout our visit, servers brought around samples of many menu items. The fish fry was so good and the slaw was perfect. My husband even loved the slaw, and he's usually critical of slaw. I also enjoyed the pork chop sample very much.\n\nThe staff working were all eager to explain the food and drinks and were genuinely excited about the opening and how great the menu is. I loved their enthusiasm. The Food Fight leadership team there were great and welcoming. The sense of pride they all have in the food and the space was infectious. That, more than anything else, makes me look forward to my return trip.", "business_id": "9ofDKryDCTnkAZXKzLcQ8w", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2015-09-06", "length": 303, "open": 0}

I had the Hummus bowl with steak shawarma with the chopped salad, red cabbage and onions with the tahini sauce, pita bread on the side. I took my cue from what many of the people were having in the dining area as to what to order. Even though I came in at around 3 pm, the line was substantial, but moved quickly. It was pretty good and filled me up, even though it was salty. I thought the combo was a waste of money and extra calories I didn't need, so I stuck with the water they had on the soda fountain. Have to put in here that instead of the hummus, I could have had the green romaine lettuce they had on offer. For those that don't want a pop or the free water they do have a small refrigerated case of plain and flavored waters by the bottle/can and containers of their hummus for sale. Jesse S. is right; you can get better Mediterranean food on State Street much more inexpensively. Last, I have to say, if you want to eat your food there, it is very loud and noisy with nothing to absorb the sound, but since your out and in pretty quickly, it is not as bad as a place with wait service.", "business_id": "JGO4o4rIh3CYGhJVmace2Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 0, "date": "2015-09-18", "length": 251, "open": 0}
