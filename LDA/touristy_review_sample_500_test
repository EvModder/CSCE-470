Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.\n\nOne of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.  \n\nThis time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary. \n\nThey have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.

Kind of unfortunate for us considering we live here now but its nice to spend a night away in a resort.  I'm giving it 4 stars but it really should be 3.5.  Its just above average.\n\nAnd this is quite a resort.  I am personally not a fan of the mega huge family resort; mainly because its so hard to find your way around and it takes forever to get from point A to point B.  When its 115 degrees out these walks are particularly trying.  \n\nChecking into the resort left less than a favorable impression on me.  I was laden with a heavy suitcase, laptop bag, as well as my husband's suit and my dress.  After I helped other guests sort out the line situation (seriously, why would you stand around in a huge crowd? Form a line!)  I asked the desk attendant to call a bell hop to take my bags to my room because it was a considerable walk away.  \"Oh, you can just go down that flight of stairs out to where the valet is and find a bell hop.\"  Hmm, ok, no.  If I wasn't laden down with bags perhaps I could walk down the steps but I have all this heavy stuff which is why I asked for the bell hop in the first place!  How does a front desk not call a bell hop for you?!  As I later found out I was supposed to receive a welcoming package from my husband's company that the front desk failed to give me.  Stellar.\n\nOur room was nice and large; they are all suites.  The room service menu has to be the most reasonably priced room service menu ever.  Some of the items were cheaper via room service than in the restaurants!  Our room overlooked an \"adult pool\" that had kids swimming in it.  This really grinds my gears...especially when the resort has a waterpark!  The waterpark is an experience....there are kids everywhere, three slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool.  Its all on a small scale.  They have two restaurants at the \"Oasis\" which both serve the same menu.  At night when the slides close they show a movie over the wave pool area.  \n\nThe formal events (dinner and receptions) that we attended were well done, the food was good in all instances.  The bartenders were very nice and quickly learned the drinks we were ordering.  \n\nWould I stay here again?  No, not if it wasn't for a business event.  Would I suggest it to friends visiting?

Yes it was Fryday night 3/18/11 and it took us 45 minutes just to drive from the city into the canyon and through the windy roads of the Tonto National Forest to get to the isolated LAKESIDE RESTAURANT & CANTINA going back was no option for 5 of us who were ready to have an All You Can Eat Fish & Chips dinner. (RATED: AWFUL)\n\n2) Wait time to take dinner order - The cashier got us to a table and turned out to become our waitress she gave us menus and stayed at the cash register forgetting about us for another 20 minutes. Perhaps we should have read the menu another few times to pass the time but reading it was beside the point since we all were here for the All You Can Eat Fish & Chips dinner. (RATED: AWFUL)\n\n2) Wait time to be served - This had to be the WORST waste of time ever no food was being server to us as it turned out the cashier that took our order did not place it with the kitchen but held on to it only to eventually pass it off to another waitress who then took the order in late. YES we arrived at 5:45 PM and dinner got to the table by 7:00 pm the restaurant closes at 8:00 PM (RATED: WORST)\n\n3) Food Quality and Presentation - As soon as the food arrived thinking ahead perhaps ordering the second round of ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH & CHIPS might be a good idea since our first serving took over 30 minutes. But taking the first bite confirmed we just entered The Kitchen from HELL - burned fried fish all dried out and crunchy not even close to eatable.  Hungry as we were trying to find just a small portion of fish that was not over cooked was like digging for gold in a dried out mine. (RATED: WORSE THAN WORSE)\n\n4) Responsiveness and knowledge of servers - NEVER ask for seconds in this restaurant if you don't want your head bit off by a YELLING waitress saying she's been working since 10:00 AM and that we should not complain about waiting since she was tired. Perhaps the waitress had a bad day but yelling at customers who came for ALL YOU CAN EAT our expectations are at least that we could get a 2nd round of Fish and hopefully not dried out and burned to a crisp.  Any waitress that yells at customers perhaps should find a less stressful job like get an office job or just stay at home and make babies. If the kitchen is too hot then get out. Or as Donald Trump would say YOU'RE FIRED! (RATED: IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE THAN WORSE)\n\n5) Noise level - ambient - Normally when the customers are chatting it can be noisy but when the ENTIRE restaurant stops talking because a raving waitress is YELLING at hungry and very patience customers....that NOISE LEVEL is just unacceptable .

My experience here was fabulous - great service, very clean place, and excellent food. When I was in Vegas in December, my dad and I saw an ad in the yellow pages in our hotel for Habib's.  Being Persian and constantly craving Persian food, I asked my dad (who is from Iran) to go with me.\n\nWe came here for lunch, and ordered entirely too much food.  We started off with must o'khiar to dip the bread in, and it was fantastic.  I ate too much bread though, which is probably why I left here feeling so painfully full.  We also each got doogh (a yogurt drink) which is carbonated - again, probably contributed to the fullness.  He got kabobs of some sort (I can't remember what kind), while I ordered koresht fesenjan (chicken in a pomegranate and walnut sauce).  It was absolutely delicious, and I was sad that I was too full to finish it.  So I got the rest of it to go and gave it to my dad, since he was flying out that day and could eat some while at the airport.  The total bill was $48, which was quite expensive for lunch for two, but like I said, we ordered way too much food, considering it was lunchtime.  But the quality of the food was fantastic, and Habib came over and talked to us quite a bit and made sure everything was to our liking.  There were quite a few people that came in who you could tell were regulars - they were greeted like they were old friends.\n\nAlso check out the market section - they have a large variety of food (some of which we have trouble finding in Florida), so we spent some money in there as well :)", "business_id": "QkVSaXjg5475VD3sZixCZQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2009-04-02", "length": 306, "open": 0}

One basic place everyone will want to start out at when tasting Persian cuisine is the Koobideh.  If you're Persian you will know right away whether the rest of the menu items will be good and if a follow on visit is needed.  If you are American (and are meat eater like me) it's a safe dish to go with.  I can tell you the Koobideh at Habib's is very good.  The Basmati rice served at this place is also perfect.  \n\nDon't forget the Maast-o Khiar either.  It's another standard to tell you not only how they prepare the food, but also how they hold the items prepared for the day.  A good Maast-o Khiar like the one served at Habib's is always a pleasure.\n\nThe Ghormeh Sabzi served was also good.  I would have preferred some lamb in the stew as well.  But a vegetarian Ghormeh Sabzi is always delicious stew.  For you dyed in the wool American out give this dish a chance.  It may look super dark green like overcooked spinach, but the flavor is definitely tasty and nothing like spinach.   \n\nFor those reading this review I am not Persian.  But I did fall in love with the food and now cook a wide range of Persian meals often at home.  Habib is not a strictly Persian place as evidenced by having hummus on the menu.  Some of the dishes are a little Americanized to bridge the gap.  But I would say this a decent place to start your love affair with Persian cooking.\n\nThough it's not on the menu you should ask for a serving of Tadig to go along with the stews.  This portion of the basmati rice preparation is a great compliment to the stew. \n\nAs it's been mentioned Habib's interior does have a few failing points.  And the location itself can be easy to miss when tying to find it.

I would rather lick the grease off the tracks of the Duquesne Incline next door than suffer through another meal here again.\n\nThe entire Grandview concept appears to be premised on the belief that as long as you've got a phenomenal view, you can charge inflated prices for food you'd be offended to find in a middle school cafeteria. In general, the food I saw was all-American in the worst possible sense - bland, slimy, and whenever possible, smothered with cheese.\n\nIn our case, the chicken marsala recipe eschewed the traditional topping for some kind of watery combination of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The shrimp scampi tasted as if it was prepared by a chef without a tongue. Our request for pita chips that were simply warm, not fried, elicited a significant delay from the kitchen, as if they couldn't figure out why any of their customers wouldn't want to slurp up something lathered in butter and oil.\n\nFrankly, we should have run out the door the moment we sat down.  My brother-in-law aptly described the decor as a Days Inn ballroom circa 1995.  The walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them.  Of course, you've got an incredible view of the downtown skyline, but that's no excuse for such hideous decorative malfeasance.  After all, Vincent van Gogh didn't frame Starry Night in particle board he pulled from a dumpster.\n\nIf you've got even one iota of romantic feeling left after surveying what must surely be an accurate replica of Purgatory, the Top 40 hits from five year ago blaring over the soundtrack will surely kill the mood once and for all.  While you enjoy the strains of Pink's \"Get the Party Started,\" you'll be left munching on beer-battered blobs, silently wondering why your life feels so empty and numb.\n\nTo think that I paid almost $70 here for a two-person dinner that didn't even include alcohol makes me want to gnaw off my own pinkie with rage.  That experience would be tastier, cheaper, and far more pleasant than my time at Grandview.  However, my sacrifice will only achieve some higher meaning if I can serve as a warning to the rest of humanity.

Go out on a sat to the artist market up there and buy something.  Not all your tables have the view of the city, give these people something to look at while they are waiting for their overpriced meal.", "business_id": "wgSCc7Ut2C4OkmvoeSLIrQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2010-07-14", "length": 140, "open": 0}

First, let me say I would only stay here with my kids as the rooms are only OK.  It's a Sheraton branded property, which is part of the Starwood program (always stick with your loyalty program).  But there is the slide.. Sorry not yet.\n\nThe architecture is that Santa Fe look with cactus and a  casino nearby (the hotel is on a reservation).  It is a maze of rooms and you could be walking really far to your room.  and there is the slide... oh not yet.\n\nFinally, there is the resort charge.  Generally I don't stay in hotels with a resort charge as I'm on business and don't get to use the facilities.  On this trip I was with the family and we spent a bunch of time in the pool.  I think my kids will always like phoenix because of the pools.  They are amazing.  Which brings me to the slide (a water slide to be exact).  About 20 feet high, a tight corkscrew that is faster than I care to go (although I rode it about 20 times over an afternoon). \n\nThe best part is your going down it with a million kids.  It's like a conga line of death at (what seems like) 50 miles an hour.  It is great.  Go off season as I would feel like a chump paying full rack to go here.  Bring the kids.

Just got back from four days in Henderson / Vegas and I got a room here that was a comp, so I have no  clue how much it even costs, but here is the low-down. Its obviously a bargain type hotel/ casino. They do have a $1.00 breakfast to bring people in, and its marginal, but as soon as you walk in the doors of the hotel/casino, you instantly get that tobacco smell that seems to linger until you get in your non-smoking room, provided thats where you are. The run down elevators are a microcosm to what kind of place it is, but the rooms are clean and the air works so once inside, its a decent and roomy place. Surprising was the bed I had. Actually a comfortable mattress, so the decent black-out curtains allowed me to sleep in a bit. i can't comment on the gambling there since I don't gamble, but overall, my experience was decent. I advise you to stay away from the lunch buffet. Bland food, orange colored water they pass off as orange juice, and our waitress seemed like she couldn't wait to get home. Can you blame her? \n\nI've always thought, if you want to know how the food is, look around at the people eating it. After looking at the people eating it, I wanted to get the holy H out of there.

We found this little gem on the way back from visiting Hoover Dam 2 weeks ago on our vacation in Vegas and decided to check it out.  It was cold and windy outside of the casino somewhere in the low 40's.  For 2 Hawaii people that is frigid.  Walking into the casino to the welcoming warmth was wonderful.   Since we never went to Railroad Pass during the morning hours I can't comment on their breakfast or lunch or the crew who work the early shifts.  Our visits were always after 5:00 p.m. through about midnight.\n\nOur focus when we travel to Vegas is craps and we headed to the crap table delighted to see the table minimum was only $1.  The crew there  is absolutely the best.  They  were warm and friendly and we can't say enough about the pit boss \"Monte\" who is by far the nicest pit boss we have met in all of Vegas.  We could tell he genuinely likes people and we felt welcomed by him and his crew.\n\nAfter shooting craps we headed to the rear of the cozy casino the the Iron Rail Cafe.  The hostess, Darla, was warm and pleasant just like the rest of the employees there.  Our waitress, Cheryl, was also very efficient and nice.  I had the salmon and my husband had steak.   The fish was moist and flaky meaning it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  My husband's steak was cooked medium rare, the way he ordered it.  The second time we both had steak and shrimp and that was cooked well too.   I didn't care much for the chicken breast appetizers because they were dry and overcooked, but the potato skins, buffalo wings and fried mozzarella were good.  The vegetables that come with the entrees are canned instead of fresh or frozen.   Probably the best surprise was their banana cream pie!  It is deliciously fresh and creamy and sinful.  We had to eat it again the next time we visited there because it surpasses any banana cream pie we have eaten.  Yes, we even chose it over the strawberry shortcake which I hear is awesome.  \n\nFood aside, we drove all the way out to Henderson 4  times during our trip mainly to spend time with the crew and gamble.  If we had discovered Railroad Pass the first week of our vacation we would have gone there even more often.  It was out of our way really but that is how much we like it there.   You can't beat a $1 minimum crap table with an awesome crew.  By the way, the slot machines we played seemed to be a bit looser than other casinos so I actually made some money a couple of times and didn't lose as much as I normally do at other casinos.\n\nWe feel at home at Railroad Pass and would like to experience staying there for a couple of nights to see what that is like.

It was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because we didn't have to drive round and round, park, and lug our luggage 5 miles like on the Strip. Bad because it piled up and sometimes we'd have to wait long but oh wellz.\nWe walk in and the lady at the Counter is as SWEET AS CAN BE. Very nice, helpful, and just plain sweet.\n\nThe room was okay. Not too bad, not too great, just meh. Right when I walk in my mama goes \"there's a red dot on the ground and I don't know what it is!\" LOL... Ummm okay? We just avoided it. Whatever. It looked like Cool Aid. \nThe sink was tiny. Dude. What the F. Like seriously. \n\nWe just got ready and slept so it wasn't a big deal at all. I've stayed everywhere. Doesn't matter to me.\n\nOne thing I liked is that it's a short walk downstairs, to the room, to the car, to the Fremont Street Experience, and just to about everywhere. One gripe is that it's so far from the Strip but it was nice to get to check out Old School LV ya know?", "business_id": "waW8k-4ebmByGUJtndmnJQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 0, "date": "2008-07-11", "length": 381, "open": 0}

(2) FREE corner suites.   \n\nSince my Dad wanted to go to the Freemont Street Experience (which actually is awesome) our whole family flew in from different states, met at the airport and drove a rental over to here.  Parking was free and very easy to use, nice and close in their own garage.   And since it was near his birthday we were treating him by acting a little more lavish.  Since none of us gamble we never spend much in Vegas anyway so we decided to splurge here and I had reserved two entire corner suites near the top.  \n\nWhen arriving at the check in counter, there was a huge and I do mean HUGE line of people ranging from bewildered and mildly confused, to pretty pissed off.    Apparently the credit card machines went down, and they were manually writing down card numbers on paper (that sounds real safe huh, to leave your card number on a piece of paper in a Las Vegas Casino Hotel?\").   Well, whatever.  After standing in line nearly an hour I was just glad to get our keys.   \n\nThe rooms were in fact HUGE with a great view out three sides of the building (both suites combined).    We had a great time the whole weekend, really enjoyed the Freemont Street Experience.  This is the perfect place to stay as when you walk out on the street, you're there at the center.   \n\nIn checking my credit card bill over the next few months I never saw the charge for our rooms.   And in fairness (maybe I am too honest for my own good), I did call there and asked for a copy of my receipt, letting them know that they never charged me.   And after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes a lady came back and told me that she had no record of us having ever stayed there.  \n\nSo there's how I got $700 in free suites in Las Vegas.

I highly recommend it although I will not name who they are for the sake of their privacy (they are like the kennedys). The other good thing about \"the nugg\" was the 13.99 champagne buffet brunch.

This was not my first time to this location, but perhaps over a year since i have dined at Red Lobster. I just remember the amazing cheddar bay biscuits they bring freshly baked to the table. It was the best part of the meal here, always. I could eat the whole basket right when they bring it out and sometimes I do and then get too full to eat an entree.\n\nThe reason we chose Red Lobster for our early dinner was because there was an ad in the mail for $29.99 for 2 people to dine - 2 salads, 2 entrees, and choice of appetizer or desssert. As great as it sounded, I knew there would be a catch but we went anyways as I had been craving the biscuits. After waiting about 10 minutes to be seated, when it wasn't even busy... I was so disappointed with the deal. I knew the entees would be limited, but so were the desserts and appetizers, to only 3 choices of each. We also had a coupon with the ad that is $4 off two dinners, and the server said we could've used it with the $29.99 offer.\n\nBut I really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos. So that's what we ended up doing, lobster nachos and shrimp scampi to share. Pictures will be posted. The first 3 bites of each item was great! But that was about it. Then the nachos were soggy and there wasn't much lobster, and then the scampi was filled with small shrimps, but after about 3 bites I felt sick.\n\nThe server was very nice though. But I completely agree with the current rating of this restaurant, about 2.5 stars. Not worth the price for what you get. There's so many better quality or better value restaurants.\n\nI'll just have to learn to make the cheddar biscuits myself!

But I would have expected a real apology and some form of make good from our huffy waiter, who acted genuinely upset with me for being in the way of my falling food. So I waited for a new plate of gnocchi to arrive and enjoyed the group's company. After we paid our $1500 bill, I walked over to my waiter and quietly asked if there was anything he could do for my shirt.  Here I'm thinking maybe $80 towards a new shirt, a comped bottle of their mediocre house red or even $10 to get the shirt cleaned properly. Guess what I got?

The atmosphere boasted an array of multi South East Asian designs combined with today's deco(r) of stressed stone, steel, woods, and hand crafted glass.\r\nCili seemed to spend a good deal of money on their floral arrangements, filling the restaurant with various orchids, and other exotic flowers and plants that give you the feel of being in the tropics. They also have a few paintings of images of Hawai'i. \r\nThe staff is great. The floor manager was quick to assess and respond to the last minute changes we had. The staff worked very hard and quickly to set up the place; making it beautiful and elegant. \r\nWhile the bridal party was out taking pre-wedding photos, Cili's floor manager had sent to the bridal room,(where the Event manager and myself were using as our staging area), h'ors devours ; of fresh fruit, vegetables and cheeses, some fusion sushi, and fresh salsa with house made tortilla chips and crackers. They were delicious. I almost couldn't't stop eating, but I had to remind myself about dinner. Along with this, they made sure we always had a full bottle of San Pellegrino flat and soda water, plus a bottle of Champagne. I had a massive hang-over from the festivities the previous night, so I failed to get the name on the bottle. They brought some beer, wine, sodas, and other alcohol beverages to the wedding party and the people involved with the behind-the-scenes operations of this event.\r\nAfter the wedding ceremony the guest were all escorted to a designated area, where they were served with cocktail and h'ors devours. This was out side of the restaurant, which was surrounded by a moat and the 9th and 18th hole of the course (I was earlier informed). I was able to witness the of the service staff here. They were professional, friendly and cordial. They were making it easy for everyone of the guest to enjoy the blissful event.\r\nThe entire course was designed as 18 single oasis's combined with paths to one another. The fees of the course start at about $375.00. This is a Pro-grade course.\r\nWhile everyone was being escorted to theirs seats by the event-staff, the servers were making sure every one had drinks. One of my favorite things at a wedding reception is the open-bar! What makes it even better is that some one else is bringing you your drink.\r\nThe dinner was a buffet set up. Which, I always find it a thousand times better than a prefixed plate. Not only can you taste many different things, but you can eat till you die.\r\n\r\nThe menu: Spring Mix Salad, various types of steamed and sauteed vegetables, house backed rolls w/ garlic herbed butter, baked and mashed potatoes, baked chicken, salmon in a herbed lemon cream sauce, and my favorite prime rib.\r\n(Now, I have been to 6 wedding in the last year and a half. The is the 2nd best meal I have since the first one in Hawai'i at Orchid's at the Halekulani Hotel.)\r\nSo when I say that this seemingly typical menu was far from typical, believe me. The chef and cooks of Cili have taken the common fare to the highest level. The vegetables were fresh and crisp, even the sauteed and steamed one. Nothing was over cooked or mushy. The roll as I have said were house made. The chicken and salmon were moist and delicious, the herbs and spices perfect. The prime rib; The BEST I have had in years!! I had to have another. I went back for a inch+ cut. Topped it with their delicious, spicy horse radish and hot full flavored ajous. Sadly though, my stomach ran out of room, and there was no more for a third cut.\r\nThe Cabernet that was being served at the table was great. Full flavored, full bodied, slightly spicy and dry. I could have sworn it was a Rhone. I didn't't get the name, but I did get a second glass. \r\nLater to be followed with Champagne, a Heineken, Fat Tire Amber, 2 shots of Patron, Corona, and more San Pellegrino. Don't worry!! hiccup, I'm fine!! Brup.\r\nThe cake looked wonderful and delicious. I couldn't't summon the will to eat another bite of food. \r\nTea and coffee was served to the guest. What ever type of coffee it was, it near perfect. Not too heavy or too light. It really hot the spot after all that food. Which made way for the tequila and beer.\r\nI was  coherent enough to recognize the great service that everyone received, and to notice as we were preparing to leave, the quick smooth disassembly reset-up of the restaurant. \"These guys are real pros\", I thought to myself.", "business_id": "xUnM3aQI3BIw_zNU8cBgEA", "second": 1, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2006-11-05", "length": 854, "open": 1}

I have to say that this place is always on point with service and food. \n\nRight when I walk into the semi-private room where the lunch is held, servers always have ice tea or lemonade on trays ready for me as I walk in. But I'm a little difficult so order an Arnold Palmer and the server finds me and gives it to me. Then I find a seat, put my purse down and mingle with other AMA members. \n\nWhen the luncheon is ready to start, I go back to my table and the salad is already pre-set. Salads vary from a caprese, to melon salad, to arugula, and more. I'm always impressed by the variety and that it's not always that lettuce salad with yucky creamy dressing. \n\nEntrees also vary and I've had chicken cordon bleu, short ribs, and other standard lunch entree dishes. There will always be a protein, starch and vege with light sauce. The portions are generous. The meat is cooked properly. I've been on a less meat diet recently and the last time, I opted for the vegetarian dish. I think when people saw what I got, they wanted mine instead of their beef. \n\nDessert is presented very well and delicious. From chocolate cakes with raspberry sauce (I devoured that one) to fruit salad with aged balsamic, it's consistently good. \n\nBesides the wonderful food, the staff is always professional and courteous. As I mentioned, they are there at the beginning with beverages, then during the salad with dressing, in between courses with water and beverage refills, after entree coffee and tea service, basically everything and everywhere. \n\nIt may sound like this is all normal but for luncheon banquet staff to be always on top of it, that means management is fair and treats them well. Kudos to Cili management. I understand that their service reflects on guests coming back and I'm sold. \n\nJust like another Yelper mentioned, if I ever needed to have a party, I would not hesitate to book here. \n\nNote: the one less star is because the golf course grounds are looking beat up.

Very tasty burger- would definitely get this again.  Got a really nice side of fruit with berries and mango.\n\nMenu is mostly sandwiches/burgers, with a couple of asian dishes and some salads.  Kind of random I thought.  Great spot for a quite, though slightly spendy, lunch outing.

Served in a yummy, tangy pink sauce, I don't know how they get away with putting spinach in the name of the dish.  It was goat cheese ravioli (I wonder if they were house made, or just under cooked - they were incredibly firm on the edges), with a few wilty pieces of spinach on top in the sauce.

It's an odd place. The restaurant abuts a busy corridor right next to the casino at Caesars, and the sushi bar is almost hanging over the edge. As a result, the atmosphere is hardly quiet and serene. Somehow or other, that doesn't me - it's just a different kind of experience.\n\nWhere Hyakumi shines is in its quality of sushi, and its quality of sushi chefs.  The sushi is fresh and flavorful, and the chefs are easy to talk to.\n\nPerhaps because of its location, the customers seem to be a little more colorful than at other places. For example, there was the glassy eyed gentleman who had been gambling all day. He was very friendly, albeit a bit spacey. He let me know how much he loved sushi - although I'm not sure how he could tell. Instead of a regular sized saucer for soy, he had a little bowl, into which he mixed enough wasabi to choke a horse.\n\nHyakumi is very good, but is in a tough position.

The annual convention is produced by Adult Video News, the industry leading publication of all adult sectors.  The convention is inside the Sands Expo Center within the Venetian.  The expo is open to the public and typically runs four days, Thursday (trade only), Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  One day tickets run $80 and VIP has a cost of $100.  The VIP ticket entitles fans to some souvenirs and access to the expo an hour earlier than the general public, which is an advantage for those wanting to bypass the long lines.\n\nThe convention itself is the largest of its kind, but has been significantly shrunken over the years as pornography battles piracy and tube sites.  Exhibitor turnout this year included Elegant Angel, Hustler, Evil Angel, Jules Jordan, Wicked, Digital Playground, Exquisite, and Bluebird Films.  The major surprise this year was the absence of Vivid Entertainment, which didn't have a booth, but only a business suite for buyers.  Although exhibitor turnout was smaller than previous years, the fans come in hurdles and come to see their favorite stars.\n\nA plethora of starlets included the Wicked and Digital Playground contract girls, a few Hustler Honeys, and dozens of gonzo girls including Jenna Haze, Kelly Devine, Jynx Maze, Sophie Dee, Gianna, Allie Haze, Jessica Bangkok, Asa Akira, Kristina Rose, Jayden Jaymes, Alexis Texas, Alexis Ford, and the list goes on.  In addition to the film studios, a main stage provided a performance by Baby Bash, a wet t-shirt contest and other entertainment.  The convention also mixes business with pleasure in business to business section as reserved for buyers and industry shakers.  In addition, a number of seminars and presentations are open to the trade.\n\nThe AVN Adult Entertainment Expo isn't over once the show hours end, as dozens of parties are hosted by adult stars at clubs all over the Vegas skyline.  A number of parties take place at night including but not limited to the Palms, Venetian, Hard Rock, Sapphire, and many more.  The convention culminated on Saturday night at the AVN Awards, which was hosted at the Palms for the past two years.  The awards ceremony pays tribute to all the fine pornography of the past year and is the ultimate honor to industry players.\n\nI'd love to give AVNs Adult Entertainment Expo a five-star rating, but over the course of three years, the convention has seen its decline.  The economy, piracy, and free porn has taken a significant toll on the industry, which has yet to rebound.  A number of other adult expos have begun making noise as becoming the next AEE, but for now everyone needs to experience AVNs Adult Entertainment Expo at least once with your boys or your freaky girlfriend.", "business_id": "ZQIxBXDeK3-9ZFvn78-uGQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2011-01-31", "length": 473, "open": 1}

Flavor wise, not bad -- could have gone without the broccoli inside (when I think chicken-ranch I don't think broccoli). Not that I don't enjoy broccoli but just wasn't needed and it was not good quality.\nAs a side I ordered Baked Ziti-- definately a star-saver. Definately helped push it to 3 stars.\n\nAnyway, all in all not a bad option for a quick meal in the Red Rock Casino", "business_id": "EwDKWWLf0a1oW5EJ_ULhGQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 0, "date": "2010-04-04", "length": 143, "open": 0}

Flights are late, TSA carry-on rules are a pain and some overworked and underpaid airline employees make no secret of their unhappiness. But none of that makes it less amazing that for a historically small amount of money you can be whisked to any location in the country (the world, for that matter), reliably, in complete safety (as of 9-29-07 US commercial aviation is batting one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures) and at least relative comfort. \n\nThere are a number of problems with bitching, but the biggest is that it leads to blindness. We overlook or dismiss lots of good things, big and small. Jose Cuervo Taquileria at McCarran Airport (Concourse C) in Las Vegas probably gets overlooked and dismissed a lot. And I think that's a shame. I've been there twice, and was impressed both times, though in very different ways\n\nFirst time I was making a connection (something in common between an airport and Yelp?), the place was full but my friend and I scored a table. The first thing the waitress said to us: 'kitchen is backed up. It could be 45 minutes to get your orders out. Is that OK?' It wasn't (couldn't wait), so we left. But I was impressed. That was someone who had her thinking cap on, was willing to be honest and by so doing saved everyone a lot of grief and aggravation.\n\nMy second experience was more conventional, but equally customer-centric. For around $13 plus tip I got a generous sized and good (on a par with what I'd expect walking into a random San Francisco Tequileria) chicken  fajita burrito plate and large bottle of ice tea served by the the very friendly and efficient  Rachel. Chips and rice were fresh, beans were good, the fajita itself was well prepared. When I asked for Nutrasweet Rachel ran to Starbucks to acquire some. \n\nBut more than the food, the tea, the Nutrasweet, the service,  I  got a small island of comfort and private space. The experience didn't change my life, but it made the trip more pleasant, and was well worth the price. I'll be back. \n\nFood: Three Stars\nService: Five Stars\nTotal Experience: Four Stars\nOther problem with bitching: it's bad for you.

As we were ordering, our server, who for the purposes of this review will be known simply as \"Mr. Chips\", informed us that the margaritas we were ordering had \"1800 premium tequila and Grand Mariner, because that's all we have\". Slightly confused, we ordered said $13 margaritas and then asked if we could have a side of chips & salsa. Mr. Chips' response: \"No, sorry, all we have on the menu are nachos, do you want nachos?\" When we told him that nachos were too much food and that we just wanted a little thing of chips he said \"sorry, can't do that, so you want the nachos?\" and we were forced to call after him (he immediately started walking away) and tell him specifically NOT to get us nachos. When pressed later about the chips (after we saw another customer get a little thing of chips & salsa with his meal), Mr. Chips said \"nope, this is a union job, can't break the rules\" and still refused to sell us some lousy chips & salsa.\n\nWe sat there incredulously drinking our margaritas until the ladies sitting next to us tried to do the exact same thing. We overheard them discussing how the nachos were too much and how they just wanted a small order of chips to go with their beer, and couldn't help but start laughing. They looked over at us shocked, and we explained how the same thing had happened to us! Turns out the chip stunt wasn't so funny to them, because it seems Mr. Chips had been berating them earlier for no apparent reason, calling their eye color ugly (brown like #&@#) and generally being antagonistic.\n\nUnfortunately our flight left too soon for us to see the manager (\"they couldn't find her\") so we were unable to witness the denouement of the chips saga, but please please try and find somewhere in Terminal C to patronize that isn't the Tequileria!", "business_id": "hsTKn-6YSH3JsOSiYKGkwQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 1, "menu": 1, "date": "2008-04-07", "length": 368, "open": 0}

Instead, we went for the locals' version of pool party: closer, quieter, smaller, and most importantly, FREE!\nThe pool at the Pond is nice: it's completely hidden from view by the families which might be hanging out at the main pool (I think because you can take your top off if you want, but nobody did that while I was there), so it feels secluded. The pool is small, ,but it has a large waterfall to give it some interest. The chairs/beds/couches are all in great shape. My favorite part was that it was free to get in and free to use any of the chairs to lounge in (first-come, first-serve). You can even call ahead to reserve one of the beds and I think that's free, too. On a Tuesday, mid-day, there was probably 25 people in there, so definitely plenty of space to stretch out.\nThe thing that tipped the scales for me to try the pool at GVR was that they advertised free margaritas on Tuesdays. HOWEVER, after we arrived, the bartender let us know that the only free margaritas are the samples that the Don Julio girls hand out, but they never showed all afternoon. Minus one star.\nThey were still running their $20 pitchers of margaritas special, which I definitely took advantage of. Also, the bartender was nice enough to mix ours up \"diet\" style (soda instead of sweet & sour).\nOverall: not a pool party LV strip style, but it is pretty damn cool for a pool party that's practically in your backyard.", "business_id": "2A5fHLfLD8pa4YskT6gdxg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2010-08-18", "length": 302, "open": 0}

If you have never been to the Hard Rock, the entire casino is a circle and basically you are in the middle of it.  The happy hour prices were decent for Vegas. I was able to get two goose drinks for under $18, which is a great deal. The music videos on screen do not match up with the music that is played in the club. It took me the longest time to figure that out. The bartender was quick to serve and was definitely friendly even though it was happy hour. Usually happy hour you expect cheeseball service, we did not get that here.  The ceilings changing colors definitely makes for some good pictures without added photo shop special effects.  Speaking of something special... I saw Katy Perry walk by with a bunch of flashing bulbs. I had to chug the rest and chase her down for some photos.

This time, it was just the best option. So, when we walked right into this cute funky store with all kinds of knick knacks, I was a little surprised. The store and restaurant on the inside look like an old barn with great southern antiques and the like all over. There are lanterns for lights and the place has a neat feel to it.\n\nWe were seated quickly and the restaurant was quite crowded. We were conveniently seated near some baseball photos and antiques. Our waitress came by quickly to let us know she would be with us in a few minutes and then came to take our drink orders. COFFEE! After a 430 am awakening, it was well needed. The menu had a lot of things on it and the prices were CHEAP. The options were not so creative, but very southern and hearty. \n\nWe ordered the Old Timer Breakfast and the Mamas Pancake Special. The Old Timer came with 2 eggs, grits, biscuits and gravy, turkey sausage, and fried apples (which the waitress told me are baked with cinnamon and lots of sugar... probably butter too seeing the calories.) The Mamas Pancake dish came with pancakes, which we substituted blueberry pancakes, bacon, and eggs. It seemed like it took about 30 minutes for our breakfast to come. We did get frequent coffee refills, but we were starving and it just plane took forever. \n\nFinally, it all came and we dug in. We were just starving and over coffee'd by this point. I was overly enthusiastic about my grits and gobbled them down with a little sweetener. Standard grits, but they were good by me. The apples were good, but nothing to write home about for less than a cup of apples with gooey sauce for 184 calories. I did like my turkey sausage patty, but gave the second one to SG. SG's pancakes were just ok, but it was a nice touch that they offered sugar free syrup as well as blueberry.\n\nOverall, it hit the spot because we were hungry. But, if there is a better reviewed location anywhere we are looking for a meal, we will likely go there. This place is just average, but very very CHEAP. My plate was only $6.39 (grits, eggs, apples, sausage, 2 biscuits and gravy). The servings are HUGE for the price. So if you are looking for quantity over quality, this is your place.

I have never been to the Bass Pro Shop, but have heard that they have a good restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was large - I didn't even make it into the store. I didn't feel like I was in Key West, despite the Jimmy Buffet music playing. I felt like a Red Lobster exploded. It was much larger than Red Lobster, but the d\u00e9cor was similar. One key feature was the large aquarium behind the bar. Fish were circling on the ceiling and there were photos of fish people had caught on the walls. \n\nThe menu had a large selection to choose from. I ended up choosing the Pan Fried Trout with potatoes, corn and a corn muffin ($11.99). The first item to arrive was a mini-loaf of bread. The bread was good, but it had a bit of honey glazed across it, which made it sticky. I liked the bread, but wasn't impressed with the sticky sensation. Next thing to arrive was the trout. It came on a cast iron skillet and I felt if I were a kid, went fishing with my grandfather and fried up the day's haul...except I never did those things and there were no heads and cleaning wasn't required. BUT if I had caught fish with my grandfather and cooked it on a cast iron skillet over a camp fire, this might be what it would taste like. All the fun of fishing and camping, but without the nasty parts. The trout arrived with a lemon and a sprig of rosemary. The thickly cut potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and quite tasty. The corn, not so much. It was grilled, but tasted like a twice-grilled unflavored Niblet that stuck to your teeth. Save some for later I suppose.  The corn muffin was dry, corn-mealy and kind of tasteless. I ordered dessert - the apple pie - and it was cast iron galore again. A scoop of ice cream with the pie and it was a nice end to a tasty meal. \n\nThe restaurant wasn't busy, despite it being lunchtime on the 4th of July. Even the bathrooms were nice - big and clean. The only downside was when I walked in to wash the sticky honey off of my hands and a guy was sitting in the stall holding a conversation on his cell phone. \n\nI would definitely try this place again.

They had been raving and VERY excited about it.

The atmosphere is nice, and we probably just went at an off time, yet, we went during off lunch hours, so the service should have been better.\nOur server greeted our table, took our drink order, took our food order, and was not to be seen again... well, we saw her waiting the other tables but purposely avoiding ours.  That continued for 35 minutes while other tables with larger groups who were seated after us were served before us... 35 minutes for three bowls of soup, a garden salad (which never came) and a couple pieces of fried fish?  I think not.  We flagged down a manager who said he was finishing it right up.  And then when the food came out, it was cold.  We mentioned it to her and she seemed frustrated that she needed to make another trip to the line to have it reheated.  Give me a break. \nI also ordered a chicken quesadilla.  On the menu it stated \"stuffed with pico.  Served with (some sort of ) sour cream\".  It came out and was *SURPRISE* drizzled with some sort of chipotle and cilantro mayonnaise-based topping.  Maybe its because I live in the land of full disclosure, I'm not sure, but I was expecting tortilla, chicken, cheese, pico and sour cream on the side, not to have some calorie-laden ranch-dressing-derivative covering the tortilla.\nSo for the last ten minutes of our meal (and the first five) the service was very attentive.  If you like that, eat here.  If you like having service at a restaurant, and warm seafood, go to Red Lobster instead.\nOn the way out, I saw a TON of food under heat lamps on their line, and some of it coming out of steamtables... absolutely NO excuse for cold, cream-based soup... and no excuse for that small of an order taking 35 minutes.\nI usually give places two shots, just in case they were having an off day.

However, after two courses, I doubt if many people would need, and indeed have room for desert! \n\nMy meal was great, and from looking around at others, all the meals seemed to have generous portions! The food is more expensive than your typical pub food (especially the steaks, but from what I saw they looked good), but the food on offer is of a good quality. \n\nThe Castle Arms, is a great, informal place if you want a good meal and does have the advantage of being in the old town but tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the Royal Mile!", "business_id": "YO_zbgknfQMHmmVn5uygaQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2010-06-30", "length": 220, "open": 0}

My partner-in-crime had the lamb which I think was sufficiently satisfying. He didn't comment on the quality, so I'm guessing that it wasn't exceptional. My dish however was absolutely horrendous. To start the fish was floating in a layer of olive oil, something that I just don't find appealing. If the oil comes halfway up the fish, I'm not a happy camper. Then, the filet was not a filet. It was a full fish, with massive amounts of bones. I didn't expect bones, and they were everywhere. In the first bite, and I take small bites, I had three bones big enough that I had to remove them. \n\nTo give some credit where credit is due, since I didn't eat the fish, just the grilled-to-mush vegetables that it came with (also schlumping around in oil) we didn't have to pay for the fish.

Specifically, I believe your website (www.theminus5experience.com) significantly misrepresents your establishment.  For example, your website reads: \"Everything within the ice lounge is made entirely from ice; the walls that enclose you, the seats that you sit on, the amazing sculptures that surround you and even the glasses that you sip our famous vodka-based cocktails from.\"  As you know, this is not the case.  A great deal of the objects, surfaces and seating within the lounge are not made of ice.  You also advertise the lounge as being filled with candles.  When we entered, there were zero candles burning. Currently the lounge feels more like a glorified meat locker than anything worth the outlay of thirty of our hard-earned dollars.\n\nWhile I understand that some degree of hyperbole is to be expected from any advertisement, the expectations you create for consumers on your website greatly exceeds the product you provide within the lounge.  I would suggest you remedy this; either with a change of your website or a change of the lounge itself.  You clearly have an intriguing idea or else we would not have spent our money to enter your lounge.  But, until you properly advertise your product, or invest sufficient capital into the product to make it meet the expectations you create on your website and at your front door, my friends and I will be spreading the word about what a disappointing operation you are running there in Las Vegas.\n\nMatt Steinberg\nLos Angeles, CA", "business_id": "pCSbslNkq0fL5ZZ3RhUZMw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 1, "menu": 0, "date": "2008-11-20", "length": 297, "open": 0}

There is nothing remotely manly about this place.  You are not Serendipity's target demographic.  There's not much of a bar and you won't find Sportscenter on any TV.  You are at Serendipity because your wife/girlfriend/girl-you-want-to-impress dragged you out here.  Just resign yourself to the fact that you will be dining in a big, pink restaurant and you may actually enjoy yourself.  That being said, the food is actually quite good, if you can get over the cutesy dish names (Spinny Dip vs. Spinach Dip).\n\nAside from the menu, you'll find very few similarities between Serendipity Las Vegas and Serendipity New York.  The NY location is small little cozy restaurant tucked away on a side street in the middle of a big city.  It's been made famous by the John Cusack movie of the same name and guest appearances on Sex and the City. The Las Vegas location is smack dab in the middle of the brightest, tackiest, loudest spot on the Las Vegas strip.  When I say it's on the Las Vegas Strip, it's literally on the strip.  If you spill your drink while dining on one of the patio tables, you'll most likely hit a tourist walking by.  The Vegas location is large and open.  It loses a lot of the intimate atmosphere of the original Serendipity.\n\nThe food is surprisingly good.  It's typical American food, except with a cute, girly name and a not-so-cute price tag.  You've got a large selection of sandwiches and burgers, and a smaller selection of pizzas, pastas, and salads.  But you're not here for the entrees.  You're here for the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Well, maybe not you, but your female dining companion certainly is.  It's chocolate, it's sweet, it's cute, and it's really expensive.  It's what every girl loves, wrapped up in a delicious calorie-laden dessert.\n\nI'm going to reserve judgement on their service as they just opened up a few days ago.  We made reservations the day before we arrived but when we got there, we were told that the reservation system doesn't work and they don't get any updates.  We had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our seat.  We requested an indoor table but got a patio table instead.  Weather was mild but just a tad chilly so the restaurant had some gas-powered heaters going.  Unfortunately, the heaters were brand-spanking new and created a noxious odor that burned your nostrils and made your eyes water.  We requested that the burner next to us be turned off, but there was nothing we could do about the burners upwind from us.  The table there liked the heat.  There were two parties that sat next to us who left because they couldn't stand the fumes emanating from the heaters.  We were starving so we sat through the smell.\n\nPros: Great location on the strip - excellent view.  Wide variety of food.  Surprisingly edible.\nCons: Pricey ($8 for a small bowl of chili, $20 for a sandwich), spotty service\nSuggested attire: Guys - United Colors of Benetton, Girls - tight leggings\nParting Words:  Is Hooters still open?", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 1, "date": "2009-04-09", "length": 550, "open": 1}

Our wait was only about 10 minutes to sit out on the patio. Perfect weather the day we went so it was really nice sitting outside. The patio is RIGHT ON THE STRIP so you get a really nice view. \n\nMy friends and I came strictly for dessert. We ordered the fried oreos which comes with about 6 pieces of deep fried oreos, vanilla and cookies n cream ice cream, whipped cream, chocoate and a cherry on top. I'm not a huge fan of oreos but my friends said it was reallly gooood!! i enjoyed the just the ice cream. I'm not sure where they get their ice cream from but their vanilla ice cream was AMAZING! i would be satisfied with just getting a regular chocolate sundae from this place! but the dessert portions are HUGE!! \n\nWe also ordered their famous frozen hot chocolate. This thing was HUGE!! Definately enough for 3 people to finish. It was very sweet. maybe a little too sweeet. More on the icy side than the creamy side though. My friends enjoyed the fried oreos and ice cream better than the frozen hot chocolate. I enjoyd both but im just a huge chocolate fan so im a bit biased (:  I would DEFINATELY come back here for some more dessert!! \n\nThe inside is very cute. Guys testosterone levels might go down just a tad bit tho (;  haha..its very girly inside but like i said, cute. They have a little souvenir stand where you can buy shirts and accessories too. \n\nI had a great time here! i'm definately stopping by here everytime i take a trip over to vegas! hopefully i'll be able to try the food here next time too.

As we waited to be seated (about 5 minutes before any acknowledgement), we looked at the specials of the night. Nothing fancy, half price Sangrias and Bud, and 13.95 fish and chips.  Once we were seated, we got our food and drinks relatively fast. Then the night turned again.  With the fish and chips, we had hoped for some ketchup, after trying desperately to get the attention of a waitress, we had to get up and ask for some.  By this point we had eaten all our fish, and salad, and drank most of our pitcher of Sangria.  The waitress rolled her eyes when I asked for Ketchup, and brought it to us after another 5 minutes or so.  We then sat around for at least half an hour, trying to get a waitresses attention for the bill.  We finally had to get up and hunt her down. (Probably could've dashed...) We got the bill, but were charged the usual price for the fish and chips (16.00, only 2.05 more, I know, but it's the principle you know, especially with the service) I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just rolled with it, and paid the exact amount without tip, since I felt I could have done a better job had she told me where to pick up my food.  So she chases after us, and says \"the tip is not included\" we reply with \"we know, the service was awful, and you didn't serve us well\" her response to that was \"that doesn't matter, you have to tip at least 4%, or two dollars\" my response was then \"well charge me 13.95 for the fish, and that 2 dollar difference is yours\" and stormed away.  How rude of her.\n\nSo, overall, good location, edible food, godawful service.", "business_id": "z6l2Ap_Fyyb8u1dQ3VI9Gw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 1, "menu": 0, "date": "2011-09-28", "length": 326, "open": 0}

Go to the new one on the strip and prepare to have your music loving mind blown!\n\nI stopped by just a couple of days after what was the \"soft opening\".  My server says a big grand opening event will happen in October and Chris Cornell will perform.  More on that later.\n\nThis has to be the biggest and most detailed Hard Rock anywhere.  According to the staff it's been in the works for four years and it shows.  It's prime location on the strip is just the start.  Once you walk in you'll get a number that directs you to the second or third level dining areas.  I got level 3 which features a huge split level dining hall, full size bar and a small intimate stage for live acts at the back of the room. (see Chris Cornell above). The number of mouths this place can feed at a time is huge at more than 800 seats.  Just imagine the kitchen on a busy night!\n\nThe food is the same menu at any Hard Rock.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was a lot better than expected, especially the bacon.  Pricing at 13 bucks is a little high but you are on the strip and at the best HRC ever built.  It would be nice if the drink menu included pricing.  It was relatively slow when I was there.  And since all the staff is new they are eager to please and clearly instructed to go for the upsell.\n\nAfter the meal you can just roam around and that's where it gets really fun.  The path to the third floor restroom is lined with infamous and at times chilling news headlines of the deaths of Lennon, Elvis and both Kennedys.  On a lighter note, a special room is dedicated to wedding memorabilia.  Elvis and Priscilla, John and Yoko, Ike and Tina and my heart skipped a beat when I came across a signed acoustic from Kurt Cobain at the Kurt and Courtney section.  Another awesome moment was a drum set from White Zombie mounted on the wall as you go down the stairs.\n\nAnother thing that makes this place unique is all the interactive technology.  Lots of Microsoft Surface tables and a huge touchscreen wall where you can check out everything that's on site.\n\nIf this doesn't become the flagship HRC soon I will be shocked.

We sat and watched as all the other tables that were seated after us got service. Annoying.

After waiting, I flagged down a bus boy and asked him.\n\nThe entire process took over an hour and a half.

The options were fairly limited but the prices were decent and the service was lightning fast.\n\nI got the Breakfast Shuffle - three eggs shuffled with chorizo sausage, green onions, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses. It also came served with breakfast potatoes.\n\nWhile the potatoes were very tasty the eggs were cook unevenly making for a weird experience - every bite was different in taste, texture and caused me to have a bit of morning anxiety... The cheese was flavorless and added nothing to the dish somehow. It hardened instead, which lead to me believe that it was of sub-par quality. As far as the green onions, and the chorizo, there was barely any of each in there. Honestly, I was not very impressed.\n\nHaving already known at the Circus Circus was mediocre, I had high hopes for this place, especially since you'd think that they'd step it up since there's such few options available in the hotel. But nope, instead it's just average at best. A real shame really. While I'm sure it's probably better for drinks and stuff, why do they bother serving breakfast if they aren't going to do it right? The couple of stars they received were for the service, which was great.

My fiance had the poutine with smoked meat and I had the chicken, apple and brie sandwich- no poutine (I figured I could share).

The restaurant is situated in the Old Port of Montreal, on a beautiful cobblestone street, tons of charm...that's where the positive part of this review ends.\n\nWe were greeted as we entered the restaurant and were seated quickly.  However, it took almost 20 minutes to get a glass of water, another 25 minutes to get our beer, which we ordered once our water was delivered.  When our extremely stressed, profusely sweating and almost invisible waiter did finally bring us our beer, in bottles, he asked us if we wanted a glass and if we did that we could go ahead and use our wine glasses, which we weren't using.\n\nAbout an hour after being seated, and 40 minutes after ordering our food, we still did not receive a morsel of food.  We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \"first\" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.  \n\nSalad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.  The salads arrived about an hour after we placed our order (yes, AN HOUR FOR SALAD).  \n\nWe did finally receive our food, I had ordered the salmon with shrimp sauce and my friend had ordered the whitefish.  The portion sizes were large enough, but my salmon was extremely fatty and the shrimp had not been deveined, and my friend's fish was riddled with bones, we counted at least 30 of them.   Both dishes were served with rice and overcooked vegetables (rappini and zuchini).  We asked our waiter to bring us some lemon wedges, but he forgot, so we asked the hostess and she went to the bar and got us some (of course this was almost 15 minutes after we had been served the fish).\n\nThe waiter did not once ask us how our meals were, nor did he ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished our beer.  We had to flag down the hostess for everything.  \n\nI'd like to point out that the restaurant was by no means busy, and we were not alone in our assessment.  We watched a table of 7 people gulp down their green soup, and then wait for well over an hour before receiving their mains, and only half the table got their mains, the rest had to wait an additional 10 minutes.  \n\nOur meals (salad and fish) along with 3 beers total over $85.  I have to say that paying that bill felt like wallet rape.\n\nAll in all, this place was a disaster and I would not return, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "business_id": "LX4goUHAbfFFhuiYptBHZw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 1, "menu": 0, "date": "2011-05-24", "length": 580, "open": 0}

However, take a little time and explore the place when it's not a mass of people and you may grow to appreciate it. Allow me to break it down for you...\n\nThe Great: The place is kept up extraordinarily well from the ongoing maintenance and, I assume, a great cleaning crew. Some of my fave non chain places here to hit up when EpiCentre is not overflowing with people: Mortimer's: Catch a bite and a game, Revolution: Cute clothes and shoes, Strike City: Watching any Big 10 game and bowl on someone else's dime, Biergarten: Casual place with long tables with solid beer, Vida Cantina: Guacamole. Done, Mez: Great movie theater when you don't want to deal with lines and such, Libretto's: Tasty quick slice of 'za.\n\nThe Suckage: Parking. Sucks. The only two places (that I've found) that validate are Mez (if you go to a movie and even then it's a limited amount of time) and First Physicians. Yup, that's it. So, be prepared to either pay the automatic meter or shell out cash during for an evening parking job. And frankly, these parking attendants have been total ass bags to me in the past...but whatever.

It was nice to listen and realize you are listening to Lady Gaga on the piano while having sushi.\n\nThe beer was excellent, unfortunately that was the high point of the meal.

Brainless, hot waitresses in scanty nurse get ups, food that is frighteningly high in fat and calories, marginal 80's music videos playing, customers wearing hospital smocks, shakes with butter on top, fat bastards getting free meals. Sounds like a cheese ball train wreck to me. But alas, I was talked into going here last night and have to say my prejudgment was wrong. \n\nLet's start with the waitresses. As a Vegas resident, hot waitresses are all over the place, and do not entice me to eat somewhere. Don't get me wrong I love checking out hotness as much as the next guy. I just think it's usually kind of a cheap gimmick to get business. The gals here though are quite personable and some are pretty funny on how they present the whole concept of the unhealthiness of this place. They celebrate what they offer, with humor.

They text their orders in too which is kind of cool.\n\nThe food. Man, some of this stuff sounds pretty disgusting. The onions are saut\u00e9ed in pig lard. The fries are fresh cut and fried in lard. Both are full of rich flavor. If you demand crisp fries, it ain't happening here....but they are delish. The buns are fresh and come from a local bakery. The meat is 19% fat and comes from locally owned Larry's Meat Market. I like the fact that they incorporate local businesses in their business model. I had a chance to speak with the owner, Dr. John, that's where I'm getting this info, the guy is a marketing genius IMO. The burgers are certainly better than most places too.\n\nI like malts and shakes...usually a nice chocolate malt over a shake. We were served a sample of the chocolate shake (sans the pat of butter on top) and I have to say it was one of the best chocolate shakes I have EVER had...seriously.

She had seen it on TV and wanted to try it out. First of all, make sure that you know that there are two Hard Rock locations, one for the hotel and one for the Cafe, when we looked it up on my iPhone, we went to the hotel, not knowing that there was another location for the cafe on the strip. Make sure you go to the right place. So we had to rush over there from the hotel. My sister walked up first to let them know that we were running late while, we found parking. DO NOT park at the MGM parking lot like we did, it is REALLY far and we had to walk about 15 minutes, speed walking in 100 degree heat to race over to the venue. Luckily? they said it happens all the time, that girls go to the hotel so they let it slide that we were late. The class itself was okay, the instructor was nice and funny. I like when would do a move and say \"look at my booty\" and smack it. Overall, nothing wrong with the class itself but nothing to write home about either. After the class, I tried to talk to one of the girls about picking up our VIP tickets that came with the Preferred Package. I had spoken to a girl over the phone about it, confirming that we could either pick up these tickets the day of the event or at the Thunder From Down Under Ticket Office either before or after. I figured we would just pick it up the day of, but when I tried to do so, the manager? told me she made  \"an executive decision\" not to offer these tickets at the class anymore. I guess someone didn't get the memo, it would have been nice to know ahead of time since we were planning on using them in the afternoon for Venus Pool Club. Not only was she rude but I guess they don't communicate with one another. I think she felt bad for giving me attitude because after she was asked if we took our souvenir photo yet and said we could take another, which is basically just a picture that they post on their website.", "business_id": "-wtBLg63MrEmrRnE6dVcjw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-06-18", "length": 393, "open": 0}
