YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor\n\nCons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me\n\nHi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!\n\nI do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.\n\nUsually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  \n\nThe bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.\n\nI have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.

You come in at one end, look at a menu board of choices - mostly consisting of a variety of burrito choices - and place your order.  The primary difference is that no matter what you order off the board, the restaurant operates more like a traditional deli and prices based on what you order, not necessarily what is on the board.\r\n\r\nWhere a Subway (most fast food places, for that matter) would have particular menu items, at Qdoba you essentially choose what you want and it is priced accordingly - and a number of the items on the menu are simply common configurations of what people may typically order if they put things together on their own.  I think it may be less confusing to some if the menu boards were simplified to reflect this.\r\n\r\nAs to the food, it's pretty decent.  You get a good-sized helping, and the price isn't out of line with what you would pay at other fast food places.

I'm so accustomed to the pizza/bar setup with good food, kitschy interior, massive TVs with ESPN streaming and an overt amount of sprinting youths. This location feels more like a quick service pizza joint with service at the tables, draught beer, and an open kitchen. \n\nMade it in for a late Sunday lunch and had a great time. Cozy booths line the wall, big cushy stools at the bar, and fun decor abounds. We grabbed a big booth for the two of us. The menu is printed like a newspaper and makes for a memorable read-through. Tons of sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, and all of the usual suspects for apps. We started with some \"Styx.\" Breadsticks with sundried tomato pesto, marinara, and creamy artichoke dip. All dips were spot on, the sticks were seasoned heavily, but balanced, and they certainly didn't last long. 6 comes in an order and is a perfect serving for two. \n\nOur server was very gracious with our vegan order, too. We ordered the veggie pizza with no cheese and also a buffalo chicken....with no chicken or the typical cheeses. Nothing of note for the meat-eater/dairy-lover, but was rather fulfilling for us. It's rather pleasant to visit a restaurant that doesn't balk at a diet-specific order and is rather generous with the time and consideration. Very humbling. The crust is fantastic and I'd imagine is equally notable for other pies. \n\nPrices are fair and definitely worth their weight. I'm looking forward to visiting this location or one of the others around town soon.

He is highly skilled in his craft, only to be pulled down by the sub par help who backs him up.  Every experience with employees other than Steve has been dismal, and this review serves as a wake-up call to the management staff to better train their employees on service and skill.\n\nOf the many negative points I can make about the staff, my last experience left me questioning if I should ever return.

After I purchased my coffee, I found a mug of drip coffee sitting on the bar.  Assuming it was for someone else, I continued to wait for my French Press.  Several minutes went by, and I inquired as to where my drink was, to which I was simply pointed to the cup sitting on the bar.

Hell, I even travel there all the way from lower Lawrenceville. \n\nFirst of all, the decor is sparse - I mean, wicked sparse, with a pinball machine, a tabletop arcade machine, and a couple of stools lining the walls. If you require more than that to pick up pizza, you might be in the wrong place. Lacking a tip jar, I heard that the pinball machine IS the tip jar. Stock up on credits for the staff before you leave. Really, though, you should eat on the sidewalk outside with the rest of the bike punx, or take the pizza & wings to a friend's house for a pizza party! The service is friendly and swift. Every time I have been there, the counter staff have all smiled, cracked jokes, and proved to be remarkably efficient at handling my special orders and inane lines of questions. There's a pretty good chance of a Spak Brother taking your order himself. That's charming. \n\nThe menu itself is an inspiration and a delight in Pittsburgh's pizza scene. Homemade delicious seitan can be served up in the form of wings or delicious hoagies, in something like 4 flavors (3 of which are vegan). You can order pizzas with a variety of veggie meats - ask what they have in stock to avoid getting your heart broken. OH AND you can order pizza with vegan cheese! Like all vegan cheeses, it falls short of the real deal, but honestly, if you are a hungry vegan in need of a giant cheap pizza to get you through band practice - well, I've heard that Spak is your Lord & Saviour. Note: vegan cheese pizza is best consumed hot. The vegan cheese turns to some kind of alien form after it gets cold. Tastes the same, weird mouthfeel, no fault of the Spaks. \n\nBe prepared to wait a few minutes for your food - the wait is reasonable, but they are actually cooking your food in their gigantic ovens, not just re-heating some frozen pizza back there. Watch a Spak toss some pizza dough. Play some pinball. It's good for your soul. \n\n412-362-SPAK (7725)", "business_id": "YYce9ncwXBgOjU6ItboZ1Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2008-09-09", "length": 398, "open": 0}

Housed in the former space of AJ's Tavern, Amsterdam seems to be a great fit with the neighborhood, going with warm red walls covered with local art. For how small the building is, the place is spacious. The bar is along the right side of the room, with the rest being left wide open. Tables are scattered around that can be pushed out of the way to make room for different types of events, and the glass block wall that used to take up the whole front of the building has been replaced with a huge garage door that will open during warmer weather. A very nice touch! That's not the only open air that the Amsterdam will have. There are also plans for a rooftop deck as well, which will surely plant this place firmly onto Pittsburgh's bar destination map during warmer weather.\n\nThe musical format seems to be pretty eclectic currently, with house and techno from Colin Pierce & Tom Brown on fridays (great DJs!).

I snuck a few bites of Christine and Myles' ika sansei squid salad which I enjoyed and would order on a future visit. \n\nWe ordered several rolls and I found each to be well rolled and the fish fresh. We tried a Fuji, Philly, and Sakura and each one was great. The other rolls ordered at our table looked equally amazing and I cannot wait to try more of their specialty rolls. (That's not to say the \"traditional\" roll we ordered wasn't good, it was, but they have a lot of really inventive specialty rolls). The specialty rolls are reasonably priced in a range of $10-13. We did order from the hot kitchen (yaki itame) which I thought was just your basic Chinese dish, with basic flavors. With so many sushi options I'm not sure that I would order the hot dishes regularly. One thing that I do think they do well is portions, the speciality rolls, soup, and entrees were all well sized. \n\nMy husband sampled a karma martini, which he really liked. They serve the martinis out of the shaker table side, which is always a nice touch, but they should think about using smaller shakers because the regular shakers are slightly cumbersome in the tight space and resulted in some inconsistent pours at our table. One of the big hits of the night were their sake bombers- for $9 you get a 22 oz Asahi and mini carafe of sake. Three drinks can easily be made of this. \n\nThe atmosphere was fun, with blue and red lighting throughout and exposed brick. The space has a warehouse feel to it and executes it well in comparison to other places. There is a large sushi bar, as well as various tables in the long, skinny space. I found it to be somewhat loud, but could easily be cozy on a slower night. Although the chairs look like they may not be comfortable, I loved them! \n\nOur service was a little off, but I attribute that to first night jitters. Our party of 8 ordered a lot of sushi and when the rolls arrived they were on one large platter that was difficult for us to share at a long table. This was confounded by the fact that we had to try to figure out what each roll was since our server wasn't sure. (Granted it's the first night and the place was packed, I assume that this will come with time). Even though the service was obviously hectic because of opening night, the owner Linda was more than gracious and was running around making sure everything was running as smoothly as possible and patrons were happy.  I would love to see Moira offer a Happy Hour, I'm not sure if they do but I didn't see any information about it.  \n\nI anticipate that you will find us at Moira often!

This locations opened up this past Friday so we went on the 5th night of business for them. My experience went as follows:\n1. Had to park in self-parking at the plaza ($5) because I pulled up to the \"Firefly\" valet sign and sat there for a few minutes before giving up on anybody coming to get my car. The Plaza self-parking is scary and leaves the entranceway to the casino on the third floor leaves you in a deserted area that eerily quiet.\n2. Upon arrival at Firefly I was impressed by the overall layout and atmosphere of the space.  Took some of the ambiance from the original Firefly on Paradise and added its own touch as well.\n3. The staff was very friendly from the start!\n4. Sat down in the \"dome\" area overlooking Freemont Street (very cool view). Not many people there.... maybe 2 or 3 other tables in the whole place were occupied.\n5. Faryn was our server and she was awesome (and cute).\n6. Blanche ordered the usual pitcher of red sangria while I ordered a Washington Apple (drink not shot) and we ordered some Firefly Fries to start us off. My drink came and was green (Washington Apple is usually a dark red) Faryns only mistake of the night was putting in an order for an Apple Martini instead of Washington Apple. She apologized but the drink tasted good so I kept it.\n7. While waiting for Fries and looking at Menu we decided to order the Empanadas (Pork) and the Roasted eggplant cannelloni.\n8. Fries took longer than they do at the original Firefly and seemed to be a smaller portion and not very hot. Somewhat disappointing.\n9. The other dishes came out and were very good! Lots of flavor and nice presentation.\n10. We then ordered the Firefly fish sticks and the Fried Shrimp. They didn't quite make the same impression. The fish sticks were a bit smaller than I remember and the shrimp left much to be desired for the price. Only 4 shrimp and some greens for $8.\n11. We finished up there and settled our check. Faryn came over and talked to us for a bit. She was very friendly throughout the evening and made many suggestions on things to try on the menu.\n12. We took off and made our way back through the eery hallways... where someone was sleeping on a chair... funny but creepy\n\nOverall I gave it 4 stars. My reasoning is it was not bad enough to give 3 stars to but not good enough for 5. And unfortunately there are no half stars otherwise probably would have done 3 and a half. There is much room for improvement here and I will be going back in a month or so to see if they improve. It has only been open a few days so they have to work the kinks out. They received the nod up to four stars because of the overall experience and the friendliness of the staff as well as the fact that the original Firefly is one of my favorites and I strongly believe this one will get on the right track.\n\nOh and I will post pictures soon!", "business_id": "mnPRnWnNLM5cdjGEteWy7w", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2009-08-05", "length": 574, "open": 1}

The anticipation is so high and...it did not dissapoint. I'm more of a beer guy and wow, they have some great stuff on tape. A dark porter from Stone brewery is out of this world, a really hoppy beer that tasts like Four Peak's Hop Knot but even better, and a number of other beers I ahve not made my way through yet.\n\nThe wine selection, though I doubt I will ever make it past the beer to ever really get into that area, seems well rounded. A little something for everyone and as others have mentioned, you can have a taste before you buy. If you are a real vino specialist you can even go into the store area and choose from a huge mix of wines and simply pay a reasonable cork fee to drink it there.\n\nAs for food, they admit they are working on that one. I've head the artichoke dip and my only comment is....don't dice up the artichokes so much, and maybe put some mayo into the mix. When it cools it gets pretty glue like though the taste is good. I've been told they plan to off Bruschetta as well in a few weeks, which will be a nice addition. If you really need something hot you can order take out from either the Thai place or the Pizza place in the shopping center and bring it in (they told me so).\n\nFinally, as of today, I believe they have a lass from Scotland starting so you even have a bar person with a charming foreign accent to provide the approriate atmosphere.

Finally, a taste of La Grande Orange/Postino and Pizzeria Bianco in Ahwatukee?  It's about time.  These at least were supposed to be some of the guys behind it so we thought of course the food would be delicious and the menu would be original.  When I finally saw an 'OPEN' sign on the other day, we made plans for lunch.  \n\nAfter a little bit of last minute Christmas shopping we stopped in for lunch and of course all morning I was joking that I hoped it wasn't just salads and cold sandwiches and of course, it was.  We nearly walked out with only two kinds of salads of four sandwiches on the menu (and nothing out of ordinary either - I'm talking Caesar salads and turkey sandwiches) when we spotted the burger and saw the special of the day was a half roast chicken with rosemary roasted potatoes.  We decided to split those but just went with water when nothing in their drink case inspired us.  Just  some Coke, Diet Coke and a couple of specialty sodas.  Just a couple.  Not much of a selection.  \n\nWe let the toddler pick a table and waited about 15 minutes for our food to come out.  I almost laughed out loud when I saw our rosemary potatoes.  There were only six pieces.  Not six small potatoes.  Six tiny potato wedges.  I think they were rationing them but once we tried them and found they had been in the oven about 20 minutes too long, neither of us wanted them anyway.  The chicken was equally dried out but also bland.  The leg and thigh was better than the breast but I expect the whole bird tho be juicy and moist.  If Safeway can get it right for $4.99, I certainly expect a decent restaurant to be able to.  At least we had the burger, right?  I ordered it rare because it's always overcooked and it came out medium, which I expected.  It was nice and large but other than that, there isn't anything else nice to say about it.  It had a gamey flavor to the meat and the bun, described as 'Artesinal' on the menu, had the taste and consistency of the butt ends of a loaf of Wonder bread.  Additionally, the bun was coated in a thick schmear of yellow ballpark style mustard.  Maybe it was meant to cover up the gamey flavor of the meat, I don't know, but you couldn't taste much else.  \n\nA man looking like a manager was walking table to table asking how things were but seemingly only going to table with men - probably unconsciously.  We probably looked like a couple of empty-headed moms who sit around and watch soap operas all day and buy most of our meals through a drive-thru window and couldn't have an opinion of our own, so why would he ask how our meal was?

I was blown away by their hospitality as they found us a table and invited us to come in and eat for free! Maybe it's because I speak Italian, or it was because we told them about my food blog, but in any case we were stoked. We didn't want to be greedy since they had been so generous so we ordered a couple of salads and shared an entree. Although there is still room for improvement, I thought they did a fantastic job for their first night. The service was friendly and attentive, which was especially amazing considering the place was packed, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The salads were very good, but extremely similar to one another. They were a little heavy on the bitter leaves for my taste (loads of radicchio and Belgian endive) but they were well dressed and everything was fresh. I thought the $16 price tag normally attached to the lobster salad was a little hefty considering they aren't on the strip, but there was a good deal of the crustacean on top. Our entree was the seafood risotto paella, which had lots of fresh frish, calamari, shrimp and mussels (unfortunately the mussels were green lip mussels and not fresh). The risotto was cooked well and creamy in texture, and the saffron came through adequately. We did pay for alcohol, which was no big deal considering you can get a great glass for $7, just $1 more than the beer. It was unusual that imported and domestic beers are the same price and that cocktails are just a few dollars more, but I don't usually get beer with dinner so I'm fine with that. It's really difficult to rate a place on it's first night, but I give four stars with the expectation that it will live up to it in the future.

My wife and I had dinner here this week with our 2 year old son, and I was very surprised by the poor quality food and the terrible service. \n\nFirst let's start with the food. We started with some cod fritters that were overcooked and barely had any cod in then. Then my chicken pizza was so dry and tasteless that I felt like I was eating a piece of cardboard. It was barely edible, and I did not enjoy it at all. My wife had a pasta dish and she thought it was OK but not great, so obviously not all of the food is bad. They have a great deal on a kids pizza - it's just $1 if an adult orders a regular pizza. I actually liked my son's plain cheese pizza better than mine. \n\nNow the service. It's obvious that the owners hire based on looks, not skill (is that legal?). Everyone is very attractive, but you can tell they hate working there. They did not seem happy that we had a baby, and they did the bare minimum to get us set up with a table. When my son accidentally knocked over and broke a glass (kids will be kids) several of the staff noticed, but not one person came over to help us. We ended up cleaning it all up ourselves. It took us about 5 minutes to get it all clean, and during this time no one came by to see if we needed any assistance, they just totally ignored us. I have never had that happen before at a restaurant. They brought our food, they took our money, all without a smile. These are unhappy people. \n\nSo I give them 1 star for my wife's pasta, and 1 star for the price of the kids food.

Writing live from Beat, \"sparse\" is the first word that came to mind. But that doesn't have to be a bad word. The drink menu is tiny, and is missing all the ridiculous shit that has become standard fare at coffee houses these days. I was going to mention that the food menu seemed equally plain, but I just looked over to see one of the employees enjoying what looks to be a delicious sandwich looking thing, so maybe there are some gems hidden there. The decor is essentially non-existant, and the furniture is a little hip, but absolutely utiliterian. There are not one, but 2 bookshelves lightly-filled with at least a few interesting reads (\"Wonderland Avenue\" caught my eye). \n\nSo why 4 stars? I can't exactly say. But I like the place. It's true that I'm a sucker for small business, so maybe that's it. Or maybe I'm just a sap for the air of vague hipness that permeates the joint. More likely, it's the way I saw the counter girl greet customers with familiarity - more than I would've guessed plausible so soon after opening. Ultimately, it might just be that I want this place to be awesome.

In fact the reason my friend, a native Montrealer, took me here was because he figured I'd never find the place on my own. Having been there now, I'm convinced he's right and am grateful to have had the experience.\n\n(Edit - I now know what a \"tuck shop\" is)\n\nThe restaurant is tiny, but manages to squeeze quite a few tables into the place; I'm guessing there's seating for about 40. It's loud, both from customers and music.\n\nWhen we arrived we were informed a table wasn't ready yet and were eventually seated at one of two bars, this one facing the kitchen. After ordering cocktails and sipping on them for about 5 minutes, the hostess came to deliver us to.... the other bar. After we looked at her rather funny and asked why we were being moved to the other bar, she sat us at a table. (Never did get an explanation there.)\n\nOur friendly waiter went through the specials of the day, and we settled on the soup for my friend and the salad for me for starters. Neither one were anything worth writing home about. While I wasn't expecting much from the salad (it's a salad, after all), the soup could have been better. For our mains my friend went with one of the fish of the day dishes, which was a cod that he loved. I went for the braised lamb & gnocchi - the gnocchi was outstanding and soaked up all the love, while the lamb was so tender I was afraid the loud music was going to cause it to fall apart. Unfortunately after all that we had no room left for dessert.\n\nThe service on the whole was good, but we did have to fight to flag our waiter down after dinner.

Monday nights at 10:00, porn stars call it a day from their jobs and come to this rather cheery bar with a good vibe to belt out some tunes.  And everybody is super nice.  From the great bartenders to the hostess who has apparently been in over 26,000 films.  At this point, all boasting rights I've ever had as an actor are laid silent, because I am never going to beat that.\n\nSo the initial call to new wacky situations was strong enough to summon out the missus, my good friend and I to sit, drink cheap, tasty drinks, and belt out tunes alongside a whole cadre of adult film actors.  And they can sing.  And they also flash more than a few boobs while singing, so if that's also your thing, then there you go.  They even play some crazy games, of which my friend won a prize.\n\nThere may be too many highlights to list, but I think one of my personal favorites was being able to stun a group of porn stars into open mouthed wonder with my rendition of Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You\".  I thought about singing \"How Deep Is Your Love\" from the Bee Gees, but that's perhaps too tacky and obvious.

Perfectly crunchy with just the right amount of sauce and nestled in a pillow of bleu cheese foam- seriously, how could you not like that? I plucked each delicious little morsel of meat off that froggy femur with delight.\n My first amuse bouche arrived- a prosseco rimmed in pepper- with a lightness that really helped to set up my next course, the  \"Not a Frisee aux Lardon\". The peppery arugula and perfectly poached egg was highlighted by the crunchy, salty bits of pig's ear. I scooped up every last bite with the brioche.\n Another amuse of peach sorbet and basil was a nice palate cleanser. Dessert was a difficult choice between the skillet cookie with wild turkey creme or the nitro sundae. I went with the nitro sundae and could not have been more pleased.

For instance, the Star Wars arcade game, Pac-Man Plus (perhaps a little too weird for my tastes, even as a Pac-Man fan), and Tapper.  Not Root Beer Tapper, but Tapper with Budweiser beer.  That was super cool, as I've never played it before.\n\nThere are also lounge areas where you can play games, everything from Atari 2600, and Colecovision to Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.  It's a very nice set-up.\n\nThere's also some really cool art on the wall, from video game art to toys I played with as a kid.  Paintings of Robo Force(!) next to artsy photos of classic Star Wars action figures?  Sold.  I also liked the Metroid mural by the DJ booth.\n\nThe drinks and bar staff were also very good.  Reasonably priced booze fare, and even the arcade games were reasonably priced. The \"specialty gaming-themed cocktails\" as mentioned on the website were not present at the bar tonight, but the barkeep made me a nice rum drink that is still lingering on the outskirts of my head.\n\nThe arcade itself?  Let's face it: The glory days of the arcades of the 1980's and 1990's are gone.  Finding a good arcade in the 2000's was a Holy Grail, and these days?  All but extinct.  This arcade feels almost like it's more pop art, a collection of memories from those days gone by.  Those who like games will enjoy it.  Those who want to drink and listen to house music will likely enjoy it as well.  It's definitely an arcade, but in a more artistic style.  At least someone cares in making sure that the arcade hasn't fully died out.\n\nBear in mind that I am a gamer.  I used to work in the business years back, so being among some of those old titles was like being among old friends.  Destroying Reptile as Sonya Blade in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was a long denied satisfaction (consoles just can't recreate it), and as I administered a long mentally archived Fatality, I grinned to myself that yes indeed, I \"still got it\". \n\nIt's for that reason that I look at the place as a gamer, and not even technically being \"Day 1\" until tomorrow, I remain non-critical, as bugs will always need to be worked out.\n\nFirst off, I don't know what machines are held in their rotation, but some games featured in their promo videos were not present.  That's not to say that there wasn't a good selection, but I was sorry to not see Paperboy or Spy Hunter or Robotron like I drooled over in the ads months before.  Perhaps one day, we'll see things come in and out as the Pinball Hall of Fame currently does it.  \n\nThere is also a lot of space that could still be used for gaming.  Perhaps that's the idea, but I MISS the days of the wall to wall arcade.  I don't know if some of the space is meant for dancing or just standing, but I see prime, untapped gaming area.  Greedy?  Perhaps.  But just a few more would appease.  More classics, and definitely Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Also, a venue that big needs more than one change machine.\n\nWhile I'm at it, there are a few things I think would help the arcade.  The games need prices.  I couldn't tell which games were .25 and which were .50.  A small note next to each unit with some background information on each game would be a fun historical lesson that I would like to see.  Finally, several of the machines eat the quarters without allowing to play a game.  A lot.  The staff was only too friendly to fix the coin loss and get you back into the game, but me losing quarters and having to find someone was happening way too many times.  \n\nAs for their console fare in the lounge area, I would love to see a list of their available console titles presented as a menu.  I know there are some (all?) titles on the website.  I hope the database will continue to expand over time.  Again, I am a gamer.  I was a little surprised to not see any Intellivision or Wii represented.  Or Kinect, for that matter.\n\nI also wouldn't mind seeing more pinball.  Granted, I don't want another PHOF here as I feel this place could be a nice compliment to the other place instead of a competitor, but again, some of those Williams/Bally/Midway titles were amazing.\n\nI think in time, this place can find its legs, as it's a brilliant idea.  It's plenty geeky, but not geeky enough to scare away people who just want a drink.  If you enjoy both, you'll enjoy the place that much more.  I'll be curious to see how it all turns out once they fully hit the ground running.  I'll check them out again, and I wish them the best of luck.", "business_id": "9s8J5SQaZYXzDnAmgXCQBQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2011-04-14", "length": 930, "open": 1}

In a strange coincidence I happened to be good friends with a brother of the two owners back in San Diego, and he told me that the place was opening, so I headed to their soft opening last night.\n\nIn short--this place has amazing potential.  It's got a great lay out, first off, two separate rooms, with large space and funky vibe--one room boasts everything from a vintage Ms. PacMan table/arcade game to a haphazard book collection to a chalk wall and bench overlooking Neil Street; the other room showcases the expansive bar, which is host to an AMAZING selection of great beers on tap.

There's seating inside and outside on the shaded patio to enjoy your libations while at Tivoli Village. A nice touch is by the sweeteners and creamers they keep a water vase with ice, cucumbers and lemon. I wonder how long that'll last before they take it away for all the people who will run in for a \"free\" drink and run out. \n\nThey have the usual coffee drinks hot/ice, a bit of tea drinks and smoothies. I was hot and just needed something fresh so I got a basic iced tea (large $3). It was good, but standard tea, no special flavor to it.  \n\nOther than drinks, they have some pastries, pretty desserts, sandwiches, quiches and salad. We saw a sole almond croissant ($4) so we grabbed that as our goal is to try it everywhere in the city. The BFs mom has a obsession to find this particular kind of croissant that doesn't exist but we will try anyways. It was good, but for $4 I wouldn't go for it again as there's a better croissant down the street at Manon. \n\nThe asked for my name and everyone gets Jade wrong as \"Jane\" or \"Jay\" so I always spell it out and as I do it, point to my credit cards name as I'm handing it to them.

I ask for it so she tells a girl near the desserts to box it up for us to-go. Later they flag me down because she \"couldn't find it\". I pointed at it in the counter and she goes \"oh I thought that was a beignet\".

Artisan Roast coffee is quite a treat. I'll drink coffee other places, but it's always just 'a coffee' without  much passing thought. When I go to Artisan, I spend at least 5 minutes studying the menu of different beans on offer, pretending to know what I'm doing, and then asking for help from the nearest barista for something that's 'light, mild and fruity'. They're always brewing up new beans so it's always something a bit different, and leaves my tastebuds tingling regardless of the caffeine buzz to follow.\n\nIn fact, for a better description of my love for the original store, have a lookie see:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/artisan-roast-edinburgh#hrid:dROJFj2gXcU29URdh2dN7g\n\nSo, as you can tell, Artisan Roast do good coffee.

High-top counters for a quick espresso. A window seat and large table for group fun, another wee table, and a mooch spot full of cushions and throws, and don't forget the comfy, comfy couch. The serving area and coffee machines are open to the store front, as in the original store, which again I love. Open, friendly, everyone-loves-coffee-so-we-all-love-each other attitude. Yes please.\n\nI think they're working on the free wifi too. If they succeed, I may become a permanent fixture, wired on caffeine, fuelled on baked potatoes, and typing furiously yelping non-stop.

Wish the burger held together a bit better and a bit pricey for the student part of town (since when could students afford a $12 for a burger combo?!) but all in all, one of the better burgers in Waterloo.\n\nThe long review:\nThis burger and bar joint opened up earlier in 2011, and I'm surprised that it hasn't been reviewed given the number of students who frequent it. The concept of Frat Burger is fresh ground beef with patties made daily, fresh cut fries, fresh fresh fresh is the key, and from what I can tell, they're doing a pretty good job of it, and students are loving it.\n\nIt's not your typical student type atmosphere (which is to say, a complete dive) and when you walk in you actually feel like you're in a decent establishment, with prices to match. I'm not sure when students were able to afford $12 meals (if you're eating in, with tip you're looking at $15), I know I certainly couldn't nowadays. And silly me, here I thought the world economy was in the gutters. But the prices are what one's used to if you're looking for a decent quality burger in Toronto, and McD's is like $8 for a combo nowadays, so relatively, I guess it's not too bad.\n\nThe burger:\nThe have several options, with your regular/classic with lettuce and tomatoes starting at $5, and speciality burgers adding a bit to that. I had the California something or other, which was the burger of the day for $6, and it came with guac, salsa and texmex cheese (noteably, NO tomatoes and lettuce, much to my dismay).  They say you can ask for the burger pink, right on the menu, which is nice, and I did so, 'cause there's nothing worse than an overdone burger.  Burger came out, it was fresh, pink to order, and pretty darn good.  My only complaints, to be nit picky, is the bun could actually be a bit bigger, because I ran into burger spillage (when the burger comes out the backside of the bun) and the burger didn't hold together that well.  Whether that's the recipe, or because it was cooked pink, or because the bun was a tad too small, I'm not sure, but parts of my burger were falling apart, so I needed a fork to pick it up. Another important point, it's cooked on a flattop, which I prefer, so it had that nice crust I love and crave on my burgers. Final verdict: good burger, I think my favorite burger in Waterloo now. I'll be back next time I'm here for work!\n\nFries:\nIf you order fries with your burger, it's $2, sans burger, $3.  Claiming they are fresh cut and double fried, I expect greatness, and for the most part, they're pretty good. A bit softer than I tend to like, I love crisp fries like the ones found @ Stockyards in TO, but that's just personal preference. Again, probably some of the better fries in Waterloo. Underseasoned, but nothing that extra salt and a bit of vinegar won't solve.", "business_id": "WCnD3K16HbrEPg7_WZXa_Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2011-12-08", "length": 549, "open": 0}

During the week they sell very reasonably priced lunch specials which I have never had, but if they are anything like the $3.00 chicken tostada that I got, they are an excellent deal and very tasty too!\n\nEnvironment: The huge menu is lively with colors and easy to read.  Over all, a comfortable place to have a quick meal.  For \"groups\" I answered no because it is a small place and the largest table I think sits about 4.  The only think that didn't work for me was the Hispanic music played in the background, but that is to be expected.  \n\nStaff: Friendly and helpful.  When he asked me if I wanted beans on my tostada, I said just a little and that's exactly what he did.  I even got extra cilantro and a few wedges of lime on the side.\n\nFood:  Very good.  The plate is full and appealing to the eye.  They use romain lettuce as well as iceberg which I was impressed with.  Seasoning and temperature of the food was good.  They use good quality plastic plates which I was impressed with.  However, the to-go container is a one size fits all.  They might want to get some small ones as well.\n\nPrice: Excellent.

It had a very pleasing texture and was perfectly seasoned.  It was served with melted leeks and some baby potatoes, which were perfect companions.  Additionally, as we were a group of five eating family-style, someone noticed that the one plate of this amazing sausage just wasn't going to satiate us and brought us over a second helping!  I think they saw the sadness in our eyes that were would only get a few bites of this amazing meal.\n\nSome additional notes: the roving wait staff was knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and definitely added to the experience.  We spoke to a few of them throughout the meal and they all had the same laid-back, quick witted vibe about them.  Although we had delicious East End beer pairings with our meal, the restaurant is going to be BYOB on normal evenings.  Also, the menu is going to be constantly changing.

Interesting name, simple design, and an intriguing menu.\n\nThe restaurant itself is consistent with the website: small, simple, and clean. The only contrast between the two is that the restaurant was busy and that is a good thing for a new business.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly. Even though the dining room was pretty full we were greater quickly and sat down immediately. Within minutes we had water and put in drink orders. I'm a sucker for frosted beer glasses which we were offered with our drinks.\n\nThe food was all pretty amazing.\n\nCharcuterie - nicely done pork, chicken, blood sausage and liver pate. Came with some cloves of garlic and crusty bread. The flavors were very good. The only thing I would have liked to see would have been some pickled veggies for contrast.\n\nDuck Fat Fries/ parmigiano reggiano/ truffle  - yup, duck fat fries. Can't really miss with these. The aioli was very small but really tasty. \n\nOctopus/ chickpeas/ kale/ tomato - very well cooked and seasoned. Could have used more octopus but the flavors and textures were nice.\n\nRavioli/ egg yolk/ pancetta/ ricotta/ brown butter - very big flavors. We saw every table around us order this item so we went for it. Honestly, it is a little rich for me but it is worth a try to form your own opinion.\n\nBeets/ goat cheese/ arugula - I'm admittedly not a big fan of beats but this dish was pretty good even for me. The pile of goat cheese and balsamic bring out the best flavors of the beats.\n\nSince there were only 2 of us we couldn't try more but I will be back to try to cover the rest of the menu. A few other notes:\n\n- the pig trotters on the website were not on the menu when I was there\n- the veal is a huge portion.

I do not think I will ever eat a donut anywhere else ever again. I used to think it was an ok idea to eat donuts that had been sitting on a rack for indefinite amounts of time; not anymore - this place has changed my mind. Your donuts are fried right after you order them at Chez Boris, they are small, so you can order one or two or three depending on how much you want, and the crazy thing is that they are only 0.50 cents each. They come fresh out of the frier and get dusted in confectioner's sugar, so you get them just a tiny bit crispy, just the right amount of sweat, I didn't know what I was missing!! Apparently this is the way they are sold on street corners in Russia, and also the way they should always be everywhere. \n\nPlus there is a homemade Russian soft drink called Kavass that I'd never tried before which was very good - yeasty taste with a hint of sweetness, hard to describe, but definitely something I will order again.

The waitress suggested that three sharing plates plus some appetizers would be an appropriate amount of food and she was right. \n\nFrom the sharing plates we ordered the top three (duck, chicken and pork) and to start we ordered guacamole, crispy wontons, duck wraps and oysters. Everything was fresh tasting, full of flavour and tasty. I would have liked for the food to be spicier, but I know that a lot of people are looking for less spicy food. It has enough flavour that the low spice wasnt' a deal breaker for me. \n\nFor that food, plus drinks and tax (but before tip) we ended up paying a bit more than $150, so the prices are very reasonable.

I won't say much about the speed and service, which wasn't the greatest in the world, because it's really only their first day open to the public.  They had a \"soft opening\" last night, and their full menu isn't even in production yet.\n\nBut it's worth waiting for them to work the kinks out because the food is FANTASTIC.  My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it.  It was gigantic. I got the rolled potato tacos (wanted street tacos, but they aren't yet available), and they ended up being AMAZING.  I was surprised when I opened my take-out container and found four giant taquitos smothered in guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese.  We also shared an order of chips and salsa.  Both are homemade.  Seriously, is there anything better than fresh, homemade tortilla chips straight out of the fryer?  I think not.  Heaven.  Their salsa is mild, with a cilantro-y kick.  I liked it, but ended up adding hot sauce.\n\nRight now, this is pretty much take-out only, which is fine with me since it's a block from my house.  However, the inside of the restaurant is lined with bar counters so I think they will probably add stools eventually for an eat-in option, but even now, you could stand and eat at the counter if you wanted.\n\nI am so, so excited to welcome El Burro to the neighborhood!

Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.\n\nGet your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.\n\nThere is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.\n\nTo get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.\n\nThe crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.\n\nWe got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.\n\nWhat made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?

Exposed beams, shinny stainless vents, beautiful wood floors and highlights of glass and copper. \n\nUnfortunately the service is not on par with the care and precision that went into the design and construction. The Maitre d' and our waiter's demeanour can best be described as surely and I immediately felt unwelcome. We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant near the  kitchen and seemed to be directly in line with some sort of cooling fan that cast a chill on our entire evening. \n\nWe were a group of 3 and ordered the Salmon Tartare, Beef Short Ribs & the Bavette. The Bavette was the clear winner. The food was good, but not mind blowing in any way. \n\nThroughout the entire evening we felt as if were causing some sort of inconvenience to our waiter who was extremely unattentive. In addition to being generally unfriendly the service we received was not on par with this level of restaurant. The bread was very slow to arrive at our table, 2 people at our table were served their plates and then we waited about 5 minutes for the 3rd dish to arrive. For my friend who ordered the Bavette the waiter did not think to bring her a steak knife so she was stuck trying to cut through it with a butter knife. When we completed our dinner we sat around for an extended period of time and no one asked us if we would like the check. After I flagged someone down the bill arrived quickly and then we were left sitting with my credit card on the table for another 15 minutes without anyone coming by to process our payment. Again I had to flag down one of the staff. Not once did someone say 'sorry for the delay' or apologize in any manner. \n\nThe restaurant was reasonably busy, but well staffed so I can't blame any of the above on a shortage of staff or excessive stress on the staff. \n\nOur overall experience at Grinder was poor. Never did we feel that our presence in the restaurant was appreciated in any manner.

Welcome, 'Stache House, to the streets of Southend with your brilliant decor, fantastic cocktails, and wonderful window decals showcasing different mustache styles. \n\nHad the pleasure of checking out this newbie for an event this week. \n\nFirst, the design of the space is stachetacular. The layout of everything involving text is clean, fun, and bright. All of the dark, finished wood really gives it a \"Hey! This feels like my old man's den at home!\" kind of vibe. Best part? Say hello to a brilliantly large print of a local mustachioed gentleman hanging above the overtly tall bench seats. Branding goes without question. You'll never have to explain to a perplexed friend/bar-goer why it is indeed given the monicker of \"Stache House.\"\n\nThe concoctions are wonderful. All named after famous dudes with a stache. The Tom Selleck, The Charlie Chaplin, The Abrakadabra (homage to magicians everywhere), and others. The Charlie Chaplin is the perfect cocktail for me. Light, herby, not too sweet, with a generous pour of gin. Served in the craziest tumbler I've ever had the pleasure of drinking from. Most of the time I'm swindled into drinking from a martini glass, but not with this bad boy. Brilliant touch with the lime wedge hoisting a fresh basil leaf above the surface of the beverage. $10 which is pretty competitive against the rest of the cocktail scene in town.  \n\nBig bonus for not only carrying great bottled brews, but also a lineup of NC draughts. The versatility of this joint goes a long way for multiple crowds. Should you find yourself amongst friends who care for a cocktail, and you happen to not be the type, your haven may rest in a tall pint of the varietals from Highland, Duck Rabbit, etc. Hopefully some Charlotte brews popping up soon as well. \n\nWhether stumbling in with a group of buds or sitting next to a stranger, a mustache is always a wonderful icebreaker.

Anytime we can get a non mega chain in the Peoria/Glendale area, I'm the first in line. The construction on this building was slow going, and it wasn't until last night that I realized it was open, as I drove to Sprouts in the same parking lot. I am still unsure if this is a soft opening, but according to their Facebook, they've been open nearly a month. Very curious.\n\nLet's discuss the notion of a drive thru/walk up only restaurant. I think it is entirely novel and very fitting that Brushfire Tacos y Tapas is literally steps away from Dutch Brothers. While the drive through is not yet open, the walk up window is. I love the innovative use of the storage container to house an entire restaurant, it is a way to \"upcycle\" or use something old in an innovative way. It seems almost too forward thinking for this side of town, or even this state; it's very \"Portland.\" I'm thrilled!!\n\nEnough of the restaurant and anticlimactic opening; let's discuss the food. My boyfriend and I sampled just about every Mexican option this evening, spending nearly $30 on enough food for at least 3 people. Next time we will sample some things off of the Tapas side of the menu. I tried one of each:\n\nVegetable Taco- I only ate a few bites, but this was very good. The primary ingredient tasted like breakfast style potatoes with a mix of peppers, mushrooms, and salsa. It wasn't spicy, but it was flavorful and would be filling for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike.\n\nChicken Taco/Burrito- Pretty straightforward but still good. The chicken was somewhere in between Filiberto's and Chipotle: better quality than Filly B's, but not as flavorful or juicy as Chipotle. Basic taco with pico de gallo and cheese. My boyfriend got the Chicken Burrito which is their standard one. It's as big as a Chipotle Burrito rolled with rice, beans, guac, lettuce, pico, cilantro lime dressing, and cheese. Overall, more ingredients and flavors than a standard Chipotle burrito. He thought it was overall better than a Filiberto's chicken burrito, and almost better than Chipotle if only the rice had more flavor.\n\nAl Pastor Taco- Warning, no Al Pastor ever satisfies me like America's Taco Shop, so it's almost a futile effort that I sample Al Pastor everywhere. The pork was fine, but had an almost unnaturally sweet pineapple flavor. I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though, but it tasted just like cold, canned pineapple tidbits. Just an okay taco.\n\nShrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold. The tortilla and filling felt like it came out of the fridge. Maybe because they put some sort of coleslaw on top, and then wrap it up. No matter, it was a cold turnoff. I only ate 1 bite, and the shrimp itself was tasty.\n\nSide of rice/beans- The whole pinto beans were VERY tasty and to me had more flavor than Chipotle. I only wish their rice was equally good. It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry. It touts that it is cilantro lime, but you could hardly see any specks of cilantro, and if their was lime juice detectable at all, it tasted artificial.\n\nDesserts- This is important: their desserts are AMAZING. As good of a warm churro as any you'd hope to eat. While the tacos were lukewarm at best, somehow the churro stayed hotter than anything else, and I ate it last. Very good!! I think it was supposed to come with chocolate and it didn't, but who cares?! Then there is the Espresso Flan, an unusual idea. It was delicious and unique, easily the tastiest thing we ordered from Brushfire!\n\nSo, overall I would say 3-3.5 stars for food, but due to its convenient location and novel concept I gave it 4 stars. You should definitely give Brushfire a try; as far as I know it's the first location in Arizona. I'd love to see Peoria as the home to more restaurant debuts like this! I hope they work out some of the kinks, most importantly: not overcooking rice and meats, and serving food at the proper hot temperature. So if you're look for a fast way to satisfy your taco craving that is a step up from Filiberto's, but yet not quite to the execution level of Chipotle, give Brushfire a try!", "business_id": "LqBkt9cmVMYrCBrxqbPuCw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2013-04-19", "length": 803, "open": 1}

We went for lunch, and arrived before noon because I was told that the parking lot and restaurant fills up very fast. We were early enough to get a spot near the door and did not need to use the $3 valet service that is offered. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, is very large, modern, and spacious. We were seated right away.\n \nThe regular a la carte menu is very pricey! A single chicken dish starts at $17. Thankfully they have a lunch menu which consist of several different main course items which come with white or brown rice, and a Chinese veggie or hot n sour soup. I think the lunch menu starts at $11.95. \n\nWe all started with the hot n sour soup. I liked the soup a lot, but it had none of the \"heat\" which you would typically expect from this dish. We then had a plate of egg rolls. It was a plate of 4 pork rolls for $10. We all agreed that they were nothing special - definitely not worth $2.50 apiece.\n \nFor our main course, we ordered 3 different plates from the lunch menu: Spicy Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and Mongolian Beef.\n \nThe Spicy Chicken was a very bland dish. It was just a plate of rice with a small portion of chicken. There was no spice, it came with no vegies, and not enough sauce to moisten the rice. We would not order it again.\n \nThe Sesame Chicken was quite good. The chicken had nice flavour, and the plate includes broccoli, peppers, and onions; which gives the meal much more body than the previous dish. I would have this again.\n \nThe Mongolian Beef was ok. The beef was cooked perfectly which was nice, but it could of used more flavour. This dish comes with a good portion of green scallions.\n \nWith 3 cokes ($3 + free refills), tax and tip, the lunch for 3 people cost $72. The restaurant and parking lot were both full by 1pm.\n \nThe service was good.\n \nI might try it again for lunch since I work near the restaurant, but the food was not good enough for me to even consider paying a la carte.", "business_id": "c1JU5rNa8CYupUNklOpjHQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 1, "date": "2013-04-30", "length": 382, "open": 0}

I hate to give a negative review as a first review and also hate to give a negative review to a place that allowed me to come to their grand opening, but it just wasn't very good. The food they were serving definitely should have been good, for example, they had a kobe beef slider....sounds good, right? No....it was not good. It was ground kobe, not sure why you would grind such expensive meat, and it was covered in a weird sauce and then topped with velveeta. Yes....velveeta. It was such a waste of a good meat, you couldn't taste the meat at all...it could have been ground anything for all you could tell. Additionally, the BF found a bone in his....not so appetizing. They also had mini burger bites, that were decent, but the way they were served made it so you couldn't taste any of the toppings because they all fell off before it got to your mouth (they were little balls with bacon and whatnot on top skewered with a toothpick, so the bacon and things fell off when the burger was picked up). The crab mac and cheese was mediocre and I believe had velveeta in it as well....how weird. The pork sweet and spicy wings were an odd texture and tasted like frozen food. Not good. The only thing that was decent was the spicy mango cone....a mango pudding of sorts with cayenne in it served in an ice cream cone. We ended up leaving after only a short period of time because we didn't want to continue tasting/wasting their food....that's pretty bad when the food is free. Maybe this place just needs to work out some kinks, but it was surprising that they hadn't done so before this event.", "business_id": "eopVWkFQ_AB53m_17bCl-Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-05-23", "length": 328, "open": 0}

Our server Daniel was great. Super friendly and had plenty of time to chit chat with us. I had their Mongolian beef and it was DELICIOUS. I recommend this meal to anyone. Not spicy at all but will provide you a party of flavor in your mouth.\n\nVisited the site mere days later for a Saturday Night at 7 PM and it truly felt like I walked into a different resto. Firstly, their location makes parking a nightmare. I didn't opt for their valet parking which led me to look for parking for a quarter of an hour and a 10 minute walk. The next time, I'm definitely going to be taking their valet option for a few bucks.\n\nWe made reservations for 6 at 7. They called earlier in the day to confirm. All was swell. We get there at 6:50, we're all there only to be given a pager and informed that they will page us when our \"reservation\" is ready. \n\nRidiculous.\n\nWhy accept and confirm reservations when you can't respect them?\n\nThe pager rang at 7:25. So with a reservation, all present, we needed to wait 30 minutes.\n\nGreat start!\n\nMoving on...\n\nWe sit down and the service we got was definitely not Daniel quality of a few mere days earlier as we waited on our waitress for a duration of close of 3+ hours. \n\nFirstly, we didn't get a chance to place our orders as she completely forgot about us for nearly 40 minutes after being sat down.\n\nWe did eventually order and my friend and I shared some warm sake which was a delightful experience and the spring rolls were good. Not great, good.\n\nI ordered the KUNG PAO chicken (marked spicy) and it was somewhat spicy. Tasty but no where close as good as the Mongolian beef. However, it was still well worth it.\n\nBut before I got to eat all of this, we had to wait another hour.\n\nSo let's recap this. \n\nWalked in at 6:50, sat down at 7:25. Ordered at 8:20, got our food at 9:15.\n\nDid I mention we were STARVING?\n\nThey tried to make amends with us by providing the 6 of us a free plate of their cheapest appetizers. Of all the options we could have been provided we got the steamed green peas. MEH.\n\nOnce our dinner was done, we ordered their famous \"GREAT WALL OF CHINA\" cake. It was decent. Nothing 'great' however. :)\n\nAll in all, if my visit was limited to the Saturday night experience I'd have given a worse score to this resto. However, if I were to go back, it wouldn't be on a Friday or Saturday night and limited to the day where hopefully I'd get some level of service as the food in general was good.

I have been watching the countdown for the new store on Craig to open for months now.  I was so happy today when I saw on Facebook you were finally open.  My heart was all aflutter and I couldn't get over there fast enough to grab a ridiculously messy and oh so good chili cheese burger and fries.  And then it went downhill...\n\nFirst, the location itself is tucked into a corner of a big shopping center.  There are only 3 parking spots near the restaurant.  Otherwise you have to park and walk across the entrance to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic.  People were driving all sorts of crazy in this area, so be careful walking around here since there really isn't a clear path to walk on.\n\nI actually had to do drive thru today because my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over.  It is easy to get into the drive thru, but really tricky once you have picked up your food.  The driveway is very narrow and quite close to the building.  I drive a mid-size sedan and it was tight.  I feel bad for anyone is a big SUV or full size truck.  Pay attention or you might hit the wall.\n\nNext, the order taker.  She was really quite friendly, but was on the pushy side.  I needed a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later.  I asked to have a minute to check the board.  I think I got maybe 15 seconds before she was asking if I was ready to order yet.  There wasn't a line, so I am not sure why she was in such a rush.  \n\nI went ahead and ordered and then she asked if I wanted to upsize my drink for an extra $.50.  I said very clearly, \"No thanks\" to which she said \"Ok.\"  I assumed that meant I would getting a regular sized drink, silly me!  I get up to the window and she hands me a large soda, which I was totally charged for, so it wasn't just a mistake by whoever was serving up the sodas.  I told her I said a regular and she said she thought I said to upsize it.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just took the drink.  I mean I love soda and can easy drink 2 liters in no time, but I am trying to be good and cut back on my soda addiction.  So much for that!  It was just fishy, in my opinion.  I don't know if the girl really made a mistake or wanted to improve her up-sell totals.  So watch out for that trap.\n\nNext was my burger order.  I ordered a regular chili cheese burger.  I specifically asked to have no onions because they are yucky.  The girl told me that they only put onions on burgers if you request them.  I said great and to please keep them off of my burger.  So you can imagine my surprise when I got home, having been drooling over the burger next to me for the last 3 miles, and then took a big bite into my burger that was covered with ONIONS.  Ugh.  I have never seen so many onions, it was almost like i got an extra helping of them.  Fun times for sure.\n\nSo after I took a bite into my onion infested burger, I had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onions down.  Guess what?  The soda mix was totally off.  I mean the place had been open for 2.5 hours by the time I was there.  How was the soda to syrup mix already goofed up?  So yes, I paid extra for gross soda.  \n\nOn the positive side, the burger was super tasty (once I picked all of the onions off) and smothered in delicious Tommy's chili and cheese.  The fries were simply amazing! I have no shame, so I scrapped all of the extra chili cheese off of the paper they were wrapped in. Yummmm, cheese paper.... If you haven't tried a Tommy burger, you really need too!\n\nI still love Tommy's, even after all of the messes listed above.  I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt and giving them 3 stars.

I think this place also falls into the 'Southwest' category but frankly, it's probably the only part of town I'm not that familiar with so if I'm wrong, let me know! It's definitely in the happening section of Notre-Dame; lots of business and hustle and bustle. I like it. \n\nService: First, this place is quite small, but they have a terrace out back. I loved the decor and ambiance - it felt very cozy and warm. As well, when I walked in, I was immediately hit by the scent of something that I'm sure, was damn good eats. There seemed to be some confusion amongst the wait staff about who was doing the seating. In fact, the person who eventually took charge of this was bloody spacey - how hard is it to understand that our group had 3 people and the next group had 5? I won't dock points for that because she was quite lovely as she waited our table later on.  That said, overall, service was a little bit slow.\n\nFood: This time around, I didn't have anything to eat other than dessert, so will definitely go back for the full dining experience. We shared the cherry-blueberry pie, and the blueberry baba (two doughy things soaked in brandy with fresh blueberries and whipped cream). If the dessert is any indication of what the mains taste like, I am in LOVE. The pie was delicious - they used REAL cherries, yo! None of that canned crap! The crust was crumbly and overall, the pie was just the right level of sweetness. Also, they were NOT cheap on the portion. The baba was something I expected not to like, but happily, I was mistaken. That whole dish was bloody incredible. Yum yum yum. The whipped cream was fresh, the blueberries were fresh and the doughy things were the perfect texture and consistency, and drenched in brandy. What more can a girl ask for?\n\nThey seem to have a decent wine selection and my partners in crime seemed to enjoy their white and reds, respectively. I had a latte. It was OK but I've had better. \n\nPrice: Reasonable for dessert. Will report back on the mains. \n\nI did see the chef preparing each dish, so can tell you that everything looks to be prepared fresh upon order, which is a definite bonus.

I often take the 15-20 minute drive to the East side or downtown to experience my favorite restaurants, even though I have to deal with the tenacity of the rush hour traffic on East Wash.  We were thrilled to discover a budding food scene in Sun Prairie when we first made the move, but options were limited until very recently.  An adjunct of Buck and Honey's, Plate and Barrel is a delicious and warming tapas bar that doesn't disappoint.  We went there on the first Friday night they were open, and the place was PACKED!  That being said, we had no trouble getting seated in a timely and polite manner.  Our waiter failed to mention the specials to us, but more than made up for his error with the impeccable service he gave us.  I am a sucker for ambiance, and the employees (from the hostess to the bartender) all seemed to only live to make our experience enjoyable.  \n\nI sometimes go to tapas bars and develop favorite dishes right away, but one look at their menu told me I was going to be coming back and trying something different every time.  At our visit on Friday, we got the cheese board with three cheese options.  It came out on a lazy Susan, which was helpful, but also a little cumbersome on our tiny table.  It came with a dripping honeycomb, a variety of toasted/candied nuts, a few quinces, and a variety of fruit.  Totally delicious. Next we had the burnt end pork belly nachos, which were good, but not as good as Buck and Honey's signature nachos.  The pork belly had a thicker fat cap on it than I usually like, so it would have been nice if that was cut off.  Otherwise, the flavors were there. \n\nWe finished off our meal with the bacon wrapped dates.  All I can say is....NOM.  Best thing I've eaten in a while.  The bacon was perfectly crispy and the dates were stuffed full of almond and goat cheese.  Just when I thought I was getting a little sick of bacon on everything (well...let's be honest...only a little sick of it....) this dish changed my mind.  \n\nLike I said, I'll definitely be back, but would like to see a happy hour implemented.  The prices are just high enough to feed two people that this will be a once in a while place for me.   If there was a happy hour from 4-6 with discounted plates, I'd be happy as a date wrapped in bacon.\n\n****UPDATE**** They just implemented a happy hour!  30% off everything from 4:00-5:30pm, much like 43North.

Instead from the outside it looked more like an industrial half finished space to me, reminiscent of hospital food prep areas.  But once I took the time to stop in (rather than just driving or biking by the big floor to ceiling windows), I realized that it really worked once inside.    The counter is long and there are all kinds of breads stacked behind it, and sweets tucked into the display case. There's a looooooong table at which to perch and nibble on goodies.

Differing from other Japanese restaurants in Edinburgh by offering some more exotic and authentic Japanese food along with Scottish/Japanese fusion dishes. From what i've read, the menu seems to be kept fresh by changing according to season/availability of the best produce available. Drinks such as Genmai Tea and Ramune Lemonade (worth ordering just for the novelty bottle) also offer a nice alternative to the ubiquitous Green Tea and Asahi. They do not serve alcohol but do have a BYOB policy, without charge.\n\nI had the Agedashi Tofu and assorted Sashimi (including the catch of the day) with Wafu Salad. The first thing I noticed were the portions. They are generous and a little more satisfying in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in town and are certainly good value. The second was the quality of the fish; fresh, perfectly prepared and complimented by crisp vegetables and a sweet, citrus dressing. Even the notoriously flavour-resistant Tofu had a tasty, smoky flavour and light texture, served in a perfectly seasoned Dashi broth.

And walking up the steps, with no other open doors around, I did begin to wonder...\n\nUntil I turned a corner, heard the mixed music and steady buzz and chatter of chatty, merry folks, and saw the massive window that let's you see exactly what you're stepping into before you open the front door.\n\nIndustrial, bare decor keeping as many elements of the Old Town building as works with that shiny new bar feeling. Chains hang from the ceiling, exposed brick, dark lighting, and a bar on the back wall that is stocked to the rafters (quite literally). Contrasted with warm wood (unvarnished, and, well, warm) cosy booths (1 four seater, 2 two seaters) and a very sexy smoothed down bar top. It might look dereleicte-chic, but a lot of attention has gone into the details. Even the ladies bathrooms were beautifully put together (it's never nice to go from a beautiful bar to dingy powder rooms now, is it?)\n\nDownstairs booths and standing bar area, upstairs mezzenine with seats and tables, and an outdoor terrace area that will become covered and heated. They'll be serving breakfast from 7am every morning, and from what I tried the food is very similar to the Bon Vivant (and that is a very good thing). Haggis and black pudding bon bons for a start. I am impressed, to say the least, at the ambition. \n\nAnd here I am waxing lyrical about the interior without mention of the drinks. Oh the drinks! A small selection was on offer, but this took me back to the drinks served at the now-closed Raconteur. Short servings in beautiful old-fashioned sherry glasses, filled with dense, sweet, heady mixings. The Rob Roy was an especial favourite. These aren't cocktails you chug through a straw, all sugary and sweet. In fact, I doubt there was any mixer in mine. True mixology. And it's come to the Old Town!\n\nI love the Old Town, and I love the bars it has so far. The Hanging Bat and Brew Dog for beer, there's some great fun cocktail bars; but none like The Devil's Advocate. This is something special and unique for this end of town.\n\nI'll re-visit and try some more food (breakfast perhaps?) then go again and try more cocktails. And whisky, oh yes whisky. For that's a feature of this bar. Review to be continued....", "business_id": "WQTs7LeEiXWCdR7G8uz2ew", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-11-08", "length": 479, "open": 1}

Walk down the carpeted staircase and you suddenly come upon a basement level speakeasy bar, with bartenders in tweed tartan bow ties, waistcoats and the most impressive of facial hair.  This is certainly a bar with distinct style, and class (where did class go to, anyway?)\n\nThe thing I liked the most, immediately, was that it's well lit and warm; not 'mood lighting' that makes it too hard to see your dining companions. It's warm mood lighting, that shows off the vintage inspired interior perfectly. Including the two barber chairs up the back...\n\nFor this a vintage barber-inspired bar. I'm beginning to wonder whether impressive facial hair is a requirement of the bartenders here. The toilets have moustaches painted on the mirrors for the chaps (so I'm told) and the ladies have hairstyles to 'try on' via painted mirror images. The barber chairs. Other vintage elements include a bill in a 'Fishermen's Friend' tin, and candles placed in men's hairwax tins.\n\nThe cocktails definitely have a speakeasy taste to them. Short, served in sherry glasses, and with quite the punch. The Bamboo was a delightfully dry sherry and vermouth concoction. Small, but mighty (and very reasonably priced at \u00a37.)\n\nI see hints of the now-shut Raconteur, but in a whole new imagining. It's a new bar to hit the Edinburgh scene, not connected to any others, but well supported within the Edinburgh bar scene. \n\nMy advice is go here sooner rather than later, before it gets very popular and crowded, so you can admire all the beautiful attentions to detail that make it the bar it is. \n\nI raise my Bamboo-filled glass and toast good luck to this newest bar!", "business_id": "rVnY7LkVgtVyXcyQ7Dzx2Q", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-11-14", "length": 312, "open": 0}

This time, it's a well-known one because apparently it's all over the world! I was extremely excited to try this place because they had a grand opening special where it was buy one, get second one free. I came back on Monday with a friend and decided to test out their bubble tea by ordering the classic original milk black tea. Personally I find if a bubble tea cafe can make a classic well, they can make other bubble teas well too. \n\nThe verdict? Pretty darn good milk black tea. It was the perfect balance between bitter and sweet. In fact Chatime offers you the choice of how much percentage of sugar you want and ice too. For example you can order 30% sugar or 30% ice meaning it's the lowest amount of ice and sugar. I think it's pretty cool they have this option.\n\nNow, I was so excited about this place that I went a second time and ordered something different. I had the Matcha Red Bean smoothie with 80& sugar, holy holy it was good. I loved that it was perfectly not too overly sweet and I could taste the red bean and matcha. There wasn't too much ice nor was it diluted.\n\nMy only complaint about Chatime is their space. I believe it used to be a clothing store and so the spacing is odd. It feels empty and I don't really feel like going there to sit and study, or just sit there for awhile in general. The design lacks a bit interior wise.\n\nOther than that, must try their bubble teas if you are in the Guy downtown area.", "business_id": "Vm807WOtvay7_rhzDu-Upw", "second": 1, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-11-23", "length": 293, "open": 0}

At first, I noticed some truly ludicrous behaviour from Hard Rock Live staff -- probably based on the venue policy that no one was supposed to be doing any \"Hard Rock\" antics -- but, as of late, they have been a bit more hands off with the practice of throwing people out for dancing. \n\nFirst off, the distinction between Hard Rock Cafe (on the strip)  and the upstairs Hard Rock Live, or rather an explanation of it: \n\nSometime in 2013, HRC decided to rebrand, or really name for the very first time the upstairs space. My hypothesis is that they were tired of dumbasses getting all irate about going to the Hard Rock Cafe on Paradise, where the casino is (which is not owned by the HRC chain), when they were actually ticket holders to a gig here. \n\nEnter \"Hard Rock Live.\"\n\nThere is only one so how the fuck can you mistake it for the casino? The restaurant and souvenir shop on first couple if levels, respectfully, still keep the Hard Rock Cafe (on the strip) name. \n\nConfusing enough? \n\nWell, I am making the major assumption you are already aware of the fact there are two Hard Rock Cafes in Las Vegas (one on Blvd. and one on Paradise)(one being a stand-alone with a music venue and the other being adjacent to a resort with the casino area itself having several venues) \n\nLet me make it easier: coming to a show? Check in to this listing and review it here. Going to eat at the restaurant or purchase a dumb pin? Check in and review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hard-rock-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-3.\n\nNow that I have wasted half of my characters allowed on a bunch of bullshit, lets get to the matter of Hard Rock Live. \n\nThere are couches right outside of the ticketing threshold, or \"doors,\" and one can sit there and relax, charge your fancy phone, and even listen to entire ticketed concerts without possessing a ticket. (This is a major Pro Tip. Do not abuse it, please.) It is straight ahead if you take the stairway -- like you should -- or to the left if you are getting off the elevators, fatty. \n\nThere are more couches inside the venue, towards the way back or west part of the space, but a lot more people frequent those and I am, at the date of this review, uncertain if there is an all-important electrical plug. \n\nI have never had drinks here, so you are on your own in regards to that. Don't drink and walk. (Very perilous: http://freakonomics.com/2011/12/28/the-perils-of-drunk-walking/.)\n\nThe restrooms -- at least the gentlemen's (do your own research on the ladies) -- has an attendant, so you are going to need cash money if you are heading in there (unless you are an asshole)(wash your fucking hands, pig).\n\nI have heard too many artists perform here to list (and you would not care anyway). \n\nA little tidbit: The Killers, practically, performed here in the last couple of years when the drummer, Ronnie Vannucci brought his side project here, and other Killers joined him on stage. \n\nThis was one of the only venues on the strip -- along with The Pub inside Monte Carlo, which is across the street from HRL -- that allowed Imagine Dragons the forum to perform live when they were coming up (which strangely, is only a year ago). They opened for artists and additionally headlined sparsely attended shows here, including one of their many EP releases. \n\nThere is no parking except a garage behind the venue that is for the theatre which charges. Best if you park at the Monte Carlo garage or the MGM Grand garage and walk here. \n\nThere is an outside balcony area overlooking the strip where one could smoke, if so inclined. Their searches here include wanding front and back. - E", "business_id": "ySccfVsGiCgQUpLNUdAb6g", "second": 0, "vegas": 1, "stars": 3, "menu": 0, "date": "2013-11-20", "length": 674, "open": 0}

The torta COULD be piled a little higher, based on the size of the bun, but the flavors were stellar, fresh, and just plain freaking delicious! We closed the meal out with fresh churros with chocolate dipping sauce, but I was much too full too eat more than half of one!\nRest assured, Joyride is now on our roster of neighborhood restaurants to bicycle to.

I'm here with 6 friends, so I didn't actually order ALL this food. \n\nDecor: Love this Asian fusion restaurant. The decor is so cute. Especialy love the wallpaper and the \"let's nhau\" quote (vietnamese for let's party/drink) in the corner of the room. There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.\n\nThe CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.\n\nAppetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.\n\nEntree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.\n\nOverall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool. It definitely feels like a family friendly environment. The waiters and waitresses come around and they always ask if everything is okay, and ready for refills. \n\nDecor/Ambience: *****\nFood: ****1/2 \nService: *****\nDrinks/Bar: TBD\nOverall: *****", "business_id": "kJfT-kJUHQ-gxq0fhu4vdg", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-01-27", "length": 443, "open": 0}

I'd call the food farm to table nouveau southern with a twist. We went the first week (really the first day because of snow after the grand opening) for Valentine's day. We selected the V-Day sampler, which was four courses. The salads were very good with some pickled beets and I believe freshly foraged goodies. There was a lot of flavor from the spices, it wasn't an over-pureed dressing.\n\nWe both had the Oysters for the appetizer, they were amazing. One was raw, and I believe the others were steamed and broiled respectively. They were all prepared perfectly.\n\nFor the main dish my wife had a beef heart sampler, which was prepared three ways. I took very small samples of each, and it seemed good. I've never had been heart before, so I had nothing to compare it to. \n\nI had pork belly, which was served with sweet potatoes, and something pickled (I'm still not sure what). The pork belly was very good, and the pickled veggie and sweet potatoes paired really well. The pork was cooked to perfection. \n\nDessert was excellent, it was a \"smore\" tart. It was fantastic. There were candied graham crackers and bruleed marshmallows. It was just great. \n\nEverything in the restaurant, including the alcohol is from North Carolina.  I didn't have beer, but I would have liked to have seen Asheville beers in addition to Charlotte. Not knocking the CLT brew scene, but limiting to Charlotte would not have been the way I handled it.\n\nOur server Franklin was very well spoken, intimately familiar with the details of the menu and the story of the chef, which is what brought me there in the first place. We ordered a bottle of wine that they had just run out of and they upgraded us to something else, no extra charge. He also didn't have us look at the menu again, he brought out two suggestions to let us pick from as an alternative, which I appreciated.\n\nMy only real complaint for the night, and the reason I didn't give it five stars is that, for the money, I would have liked a little larger portion of pork belly. I'm not talking Golden Corral, but for $90 for dinner for two, we got salad, three oysters each, and I got a couple ounces of pork belly and some sweet potatoes. The food is phenomenal, but with the bottle of wine and a tip it was $150, so I would have liked just a bit more from the main course.\n\nWe will be back, we live a few miles away near the Whitewater Center.

Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.", "business_id": "ZOcfu9B5657he_gBXVeIcQ", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 1, "date": "2014-04-05", "length": 513, "open": 1}

Anyone familiar with the Phoenix of late knows how charming these converted bungalows are, and Urban Vine is no exception. Walking up to the door is extra pleasant due to the pomegranate trees and fresh herbs planted along the path and on the front porch. We noticed fresh rosemary at the table, so I can only assume they use these fresh herbs in the kitchen as well. I love that. There's been a lot of remodeling since Coronado, but they did a great job and the inside looks really nice. They've gotten creative with the use of wine crates on the walls, local steampunk art (which is for sale), and Edison bulbs a-plenty. All that being said, the patio is AWESOME. I'm excited to come back and hang out on the patio, but this time we sat inside at the bar area. It was appropriately dim, and the only atmospheric complaint is that it was kind of hot so maybe a fan would help circulate air a bit.\n\nThe wines and cocktail we tried were good. The wine list is short and well thought out, which I really appreciate because it lowers the risk of getting wine from a bottle that's been open too long. They also serve bottled beer at $4, and I spied a couple of draft While I can't vouch for the food, the menu did look great and much simpler than Coronado's (which was too lengthy in my opinion).

Smoothies $7.50 to $7.90 each! I decided to go for the banana pudding instead (it came to $6-7 with taxes) and...oh my! It's so delicious! Very sweet (it would have been nice if they had brought us a glass of water with it), but brilliant the accompaniment of salty caramel. \n\nThe cats are lovely (of course!!), and they even have some kitties at the moment - so adorable!! They aren't however as into humans, as humans are into them. They sleep most of the time (like all cats), and one of the rules of the cafe is not to touch/wake up sleeping cats (kind of weird if you ask me, but also kind of understandable, I guess). That makes it so that the moment a cat wakes up EVERYONE runs to the waking cat to touch them/see them, and make all of those \"oooooh\", \"cuuuuuute\", high-pitched-noises. If you are a cat owner or someone who has had a fair share of interaction with cats you'll find it pretty annoying, especially if you happen to be sitting close to where the poor waking cat is sleeping, as within seconds you'll find yourself surrounded by a group of hormonal people.\n\nI guess I was expecting more of a living room type of feeling, homey, where a cat jumps on your laps while reading a book and sipping a cup of tea. No, not really. \n\nOn the bright side, the space is amazingly clean (it feels almost a bit too sterile at times), and there is NO smell whatsoever of cat litter, which is great of course. \n\nI find one thing very weird. Their rules, which are advertised both beside the door before entering, and on each table. Aside from the rule about not touching/waking up sleeping cats, the weirdest one is \"clean your hands before touching the cats\", and they even have sanitizer around for you. Perhaps I am missing something there, which is why I don't understand this rule, but in all my cat-loving ears this thought never even crossed my mind. First of all, they lick their own bits and then wash themselves with that same tongue. Do we really want to talk about who's cleaner now? Second, I don't think my hands could ever be as nasty as to make a cat dirty, are you kidding me? Again, perhaps I am not understanding why this rule is in place (it's not like there was a lot of explanation on it either), but I find it a bit insulting. I doubt that people working at the SPCA or at any cat shelter will wash their hands before touching each cat...\n\nOh!

So with all the good so far what went wrong right?  Well it was the food. I ordered a create your own - as I always do - and while the burger was hot in temperature that was all the good I can share. The lettuce was limp and barely covered the bun, there was almost no sauce,  the pickles and jalape\u00f1os were very small - not like at the qc spot when you get big thick junks of crisp vegetables - and the burger could not have been greasier. Now I have a major problem with wet bread and not only did I go threw a bunch of napkins trying to dry off the bun and patty but there was actually a puddle in my plate before I could even finish.

So you can imagine it was the most delicious hot dog ever. It might have been the alcohol, it might not have been I can't say for sure.  BUT I do crave it so maybe there was something there. \n\nWhen Ty told me there was one going up in the container park I told him it was a must!  Plus little man loves the playground there so he never days no. We went on a Saturday which is normally busy but we think the gloomy weather may have had something to do with it because the amount of people were manageable. \n\nAs you walk by the giant praying mantis into the park, cheffinis is located past the coffee shop on the left side where the old pork and beans was. If you've ever been in it before you know how absurdly small it is. They replaced the long middle table for three tall tables on one side and a short table that stretches the length of the window.  The menu is available above the order counter. The selections varied slightly and came with preselected toppings. There was an option to get a naked dog and add two toppings of your choice plus sauces for the price of $4.99. For me that's normally what I would go for, but the El Mexicano stood out to me. That will run you $6.99 not including drink or side. \n\nEl Mexicano - this was a bacon wrapped all beef dog (you have the option of beef, turkey or vegan)  with a cherry pepper relish, green sauce, garlic aioli,  Chipotle guava, onions, tomatoes, avocado and a cilantro garnish. \n\nLots of flavor and lots of spice! The hot dog was super juicy and had that snappy crunch when you bit into it. And all the toppings kept my taste buds going!  Delicious!!  We didn't try any sides and thankfully because the one hot dog was plenty. I was stuffed to the rafters. I was a bit disappointed in the iced tea we had.

We Arrived around 1:30/1:45 not realizing they closed at 2, until the waitress turned some guest away at 1:50. I found this odd especially with the high prices. Most places would \"seat\" until 2 pm rather than turn guests away when it got close to 2 pm. We got our food quite quickly, before 2. I had the Veggie Crepe and my guest had the Peameal Eggs Benedict. The Benedict was reasonably priced I thought at $13 but my guest said there was something off about it, the biscuits were also rock hard. I found my crepe to be quite delicious lots of goat cheese and fresh veggies, but the price was a little steep at $15. That being said I don't mind paying a higher price if the service goes hand in hand with the food quality. I wasn't brought sugar with my coffee and my water was only topped up once through the whole meal. Once the clock struck 2 the servers started conversing across the restaurant while getting the place set up for dinner. I was trying to enjoy my brunch, I don't care if you made good tips the previous night. The cherry on the cake is when another lady whom seemed to be working maybe in the kitchen and suggested to the two servers they all go for a cigarette. They all did. I sat with my empty plate waiting for the server to enjoy her cigarette before she could clean my plate and give us are bill.\n\nThat veggie crepe was so delicious i feel bad for the chefs because the service just soured the whole experience.\n\nPerhaps it would be better if one was to go earlier or for dinner but chances are i probably won't.", "business_id": "XL9zBtRNlIe-ZGXyCjzTzw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 2, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-10-19", "length": 320, "open": 0}

There was Pot Liquor! Right across from Yardhouse. \nWe weren't sure if it was open, because a.) there was no advertisements and even more important b.) no word of mouth. \nWe peeked in and saw a huge bar, and people eating, so yippee!!! a new place to eat. \n    It's BBQ. We love BBQ. Especially for lunch. The drink menu was the best part though. I'm a lover of handcrafted cocktails, and the menu had plenty!!!!\nWe were warmly greeted by the numerous wait staff, the hostesses, the bartenders, the busboys, and some business men in jeans and blazers (possible owners?) We were informed it was a \"soft opening\" and they were working out kinks.....which, as a slave to the industry, I understand. \nHubs ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I got a \"Texas dip\". Of course we also had a few cocktails, and ordered the fried pickles. \nDrinks were top notch....high priced though. $10.95 for a mint julep is a little much. Still delicious, and we don't mind paying a bit more for quality. Meals came out before appetizer, but they were working out the kinks, so I forgive. The sandwiches were delicious....obviously they know their North Carolina BBQ, all vinegar based. Tender and flavorful. The BBQ au jus was my favorite part, but unfortunately it was served in a tiny shot glass, so there was no way to \"dip\" my Texas Dip. Waitress brought another tiny shot of au jus...still was not enough. I was full, and figured they forgot the pickles, so I was ok with that. But then, here they were.....fried in catfish breading. Amazing. The dipping sauce was creamy and just spicy enough. I just wish I could have got them before our meal so I could enjoy more than one bite. \nAll in all, it was good. I liked the food, but it's a bit overpriced for lunch. I didn't even order sides, if we did, our lunch would have cost as much as a steak dinner in an upscale restaurant. We decided we would come back for dinner...they have half size meals and platters enough to feed the family for decent prices.

Some of the things will be enhanced by everyone trying really hard to make the new bar a success and the inevitable first night glitches.\n\nFirstly, this isn't one new bar opening in the New Town, it's effectively two! Upstairs is SPIT, so named through the extra large spit roast that will eventually serve Sunday lunches and is big enough to house a roasting pig and a roasting lamb, I can't wait! Even better though is the seating that looks like it has been transported from an ice hotel but hides am under-bum heated element with nicely distributed animal skins to warm the back (I didn't ask if they were real or not but I can't imagine these guys have over-looked that).\n\nDownstairs is FIRE, a totally different bar in many ways with louder music and a totally different feel. Amazing lighting provided by beer pot and shot glass light shades and some pretty nifty lighting. Weirdly, FIRE was a bit colder than SPIT but I am sure that was just a first night glitch and will be sorted out soon enough. Some of the artwork on the walls is amazing, particularly the casks in a japanese temple.\n\nSo now, lets get down to the hard stuff. Hanging Bat has made its name from being a craft beer bar. SPIT/FIRE is also a beer bar and you can expect the usual clientele to be donning a tight jean and an impressive beard but it isn't just beer. This bar is a bourbon bar too - there is an impressive selection of american whiskey including a very nice 'world beer' which is a blend of bourbon and smoked Scotch Whisky. Additionally, there is a nice selection of cocktails of which our group tried one which was an extremely good mixture of bourbon and mint. \n\nMinor downside is the flaky wifi that I am sure can be fixed in time and will, of course, help Yelpers to check-in and add reviews. This is a fairly tiny issue though compared to a great addition to the Edinburgh drinking scene and one that I can see being a regular haunt for anyone living on this side of town.", "business_id": "DJVxZyWo5PKapsLNPjCL3g", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-12-19", "length": 426, "open": 0}

People were super helpful and approachable.  People just came right up to me and spoke, which was really nice.  Prices are super high though.. i've never in my life purchased a pint? (approximately) of fresh juice for over $10.. that is insane!  but.. I wanted to give them a shot and support their local business.. all organic and vegetarian.  I chose the juice with beets, kale, spinach, orange, lemon, ginger and... not sure if i'm forgetting something or not.  I'll be drinking it tomorrow at work.  Never had beets before, so it should be an interesting experience.

I'm already visualizing the Cinco de Mayo party. The outdoor fire  was lit up on this chilly night and as you walk in, you're greeted by the friendly staff and welcoming patio. The indoor bar area was designed very well, with high tables, low tables and a long bar running the length of the room. The restaurant has a comfortable setting throughout. The music was hit or miss...for a tequila restaurant and bar, I would expect something more upbeat than the Righteous Bros. I think they are still working out the kinks on music but I'd go with your traditional Mexican theme. We don't really need another Chuys. What I mean is...there is room for a legit Mexican restaurant in town so own it. Your space lends itself to the title. The queso and guacamole were crowd pleasers. Chips and salsa were not free. I'm from California and never have I visited a Mexican restaurant that doesn't provide free chips and salsa. Considering your $10 micro-margaritas, I think it's something you might consider. We ordered it anyway and it was average (marinara tasting) but extremely fresh tasting. In fact, everything here seemed fresh and made with care. I would go with the queso before the salsa. The chips were impressive and unique. The margaritas were delicious (legit with lime juice and tequila) but also very small (dusted in a few slurps). There was more ice in the glass than liquid. I think the idea was to let the ice melt but I was too thirsty and the 3-4 ounces were gone quick. Kudos for having local beers on taps. The tacos were in flour tortillas and served street style. Between the 4 of us, I think we tried all of them. I loved the grilled chicken but will pass on the carnitas next time. My chicken taco was hearty but the carnitas taco was quite skimpy and the biggest chunk, a piece of fat. Others confirmed the grilled chicken was good. I didn't hear any comments (good or bad) about the mahi or steak tacos on the other side of the table. The white bean side was interesting. I'm not sure if I would go that route again but I'm glad I tried it. Huge tip: Park around the back of the building. Traveling on Providence towards Uptown, pass The Villa and make your first right. Then take your second right into the clearly marked, The Villa Parking Lot. The entrance to RuRu's is actually in back so it's a win-win. Don't park in front - limited spaces and you'll have to walk around anyway. A large parking lot was a huge plus. Lastly, service was prompt and friendly. The new employees seem happy but it was also apparent that the names of the dishes (all movie lines such as my favorite \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\", was a confusing way to name dishes versus calling it, Grilled Chicken Taco. It was fun though. This is a happy addition to Charlotte and I hope they continue to improve on a great foundation. I cannot stress enough how awesome the design of the restaurant and bar are. We also liked the street style taco and small portions for good value. Even with my few not so favorable comments, it's well deserving of 4 stars after two days of being open. I'm sure it will get better and better with time. And, if you want us to buy tequila, then we want to hear some lively music at the risk of changing your Hollywood, eclectic Pandora station.", "business_id": "XdmkYETQdOr3n_grt6L2zA", "second": 1, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-11-07", "length": 631, "open": 1}

The cactus was unique, had a mild grilled flavor but was only so-so. The calamari tasted overly breaded and overly fried. The chicken was flavorless, as if frozen chicken had been reheated and some sauce had been thrown over it at the last minute.\n\nService staff and managers seemed to care, visited us on many occasions and ultimately comped our meal.

A lot of people who know me knows that I'm a sucker for Japanese food --having had amazing experiences at Guu in Toronto and Vancouver. Although , the food is not 100% authentic , let's just say they nailed it in term of concept and food quality.\n\nMy experience here was  memorable as I got the opportunity to visit this place during their pre-opening week. \n\nOne of the first thing to note here is that their staff are new and I think it's going to take a hit of time for them to get down to their desired customer service and experience , I'm going to be fair and I'm going to say it was okay. Staff seems eager to get rid of your plates sometimes --without asking and eye contacts is not omnipresent. I guess those are things that they can work on.\nBut so far , I did see the manager on the floor , telling them how to become more efficient and how to give the best experience to customers. A+ to that man , he managed Toronto's Guu in the last and he will be in no time manage to get this restaurant to it's full capacity in no time.\n\nFood experience was excellent.\nThe Okonomiyaki was above average as compared to other places I've tried in Montreal. The pancake was just enough crispy to make me enjoy the squids! They didn't go overboard with their sauce either.\n\nThe gyu tataki salad was the most memorable plate for me. this plate was not only refreshing but the beef sashimi actually tasted amazing. One has to try to explain the feelings I had while slowly biting and savouring my experience with this dish. Indeed, if you come here , I highly recommend trying this.\n\nThe last dish I had taken was the Kimchi udon--I'll be honest , it wasn't great. I think it was a little bit overpriced and lacked some flavours. At that price , you could also expect a bigger portion when it's concern noodles and kimchi but it wasn't the case. \n\nOverall, I'll give this place 5 stars , from the moment I walked in and to the moment I walked out , I had a great izakaya experience. Although , it's not the perfect spot to drink just yet based on the crowd--I think it will only slowly become based on the service , food and my high expectations from Kinka family.\nFood wise it can definitely improve , and I hope it will as they can bring so many plates from their franchise. And to have a happy time , note that bottle of sake are not expensive, a group will easily have a blast with booze if they want.\n\nDo I plan to come back here in the future ? \nDefinitely , and then I will re-review my experience to see whether they have match ,exceed or failed to respond to my expectations.", "business_id": "WJxFcrTCN16QfW16ddE2_g", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 5, "menu": 0, "date": "2014-11-09", "length": 528, "open": 0}

So when I heard my friend said that there is a new restaurant there with a logo of a lady as part of the signage, my first thought was that it could be China Mama's second location.  But obviously that's not the correct guess.  \n\nLiang's Kitchen \u6881\u5abd\u5abd\u5bb6 (literal translation is Liang Mama's House), with the logo of the founder/matriarch of the restaurant incorporated into the signage (now in her 80s), is a Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain from California and New York.  With locations in many of the Cali cities that I have previously lived or worked at before my move to Sin City.  So it was a surprise and reality check to see some of the cities listed (Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas).  But I have been out here a relatively long time and those locations could have opened after I had already settled here.\n\nThe interior of this Liang's Kitchen still retained the majority of the interior design concepts custom built for the previous restaurant entity. albeit with small but noticeable additions.  The inclusion and prominent display of vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets (very very cool and most people will likely not know anything about its history) high up on the wall with lighting to draw the attention of anyone bothering to quickly survey the restaurant.  Plus there are WWII and Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung from the ceiling in sortie formation (neato!).  \n\n* 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine Corps. (Copy & Paste excerpt from Wiki)  \n\nThe menu is extensive and following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices, especially from abroad, looks like a sales catalog with professionally shoot images of some of the menu items, with alternating pages of straight up advertising.  It looks good, but it also has one very annoying attribute or lack thereof, which is the absence of any menu prices.  [Insert comment about if you have to ask about the price, you can't afford it. -Smirk face-]  I know from the restauranteur's perspective it makes sense and saves money in the long run, since they don't have to reprint the menu or have those tacky stickers every time there is a revision to menu pricing.  There is a separate menu sheet that does have the menu items and pricing, but no pictures.  So if you have the patience for it, you can practice cross referencing the main menu with the supplemental menu and other printouts.  Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy!\n\nFood wise, I really liked the Beef and Tendon Soup Noodle that I ordered.  It is definitely ranked in the top two on my list for this item in Las Vegas.  The noodles are the thick chewy handmade variety from Northern China. The beef tendon was cooked long enough so that it is soft and very enjoyable to eat.  The broth is flavorful without being greasy.  The Lamb skewers was good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Their lunch box items has a good variety of pickled vegetables and 1 entire soy sauced egg along with rice and whatever protein you selected (I ordered the Taiwanese fried port cutlet for my friend, she ate everything and liked it except for the pork - too greasy).\n\nService was good.  However, being a new restaurant with new staff, they are still not completely familiar with the pages and pages of menu items.  But as far as refilling drinks, being friendly, it was good.\n\nI will definitely be back to explore more of their menu.  However, considering the dreary weather, I may not get past their noodles section until late February.\n\n4 stars!

I would like to visit it again in a couple of months and I hope I can rate it higher than 3 stars.\n\nI went here on the first saturday it was open.  I pass it daily on my way to work and had been watching the transformation from what was a dodgy old mans pub to a trendy gin joint.  \nIt was my birthday day out with friends and I had booked a table for 10 people to ensure we got a seat as I had anticipated that it would be busy as there had been such a buzz about it opening.  I arrived to find every table full and no reservation for us.  I showed the bar staff the confirmation of the table reservation and they apologised and found a table and we squeezed around it.  \n\nThere was table service and it took 40 minutes from the point of ordering to getting our drinks which I find just way to long.  The gin menu looked great but they didn't have all the gins available as the supplier hadn't delivered them yet.  \n\nMy friend ordered a Negroni, which I would say is a pretty standard gin cocktail and they didn't have one, they said they would make one up if we told them what the ingredients were (The Negroni cocktail is made of one part gin, one part vermouth rosso, and one part Campari, garnished with orange peel.) \nI bought the first round and only realised after we left and I looked at my receipt (photo attached) that for the negroni they charged me \u00a32.80 for the martini, \u00a32.80 for the campari, \u00a36.50 for the gin and \u00a31 for the tonic which is \u00a313.10p for the Negroni and it didn't have the orange peel and it wasn't in the correct quantities that it just wasn't great. I had expected that they would have charged me the price of a cocktail circa \u00a38, if I had known that, I would have been sending the ill mixed drink back.

An oyster bar serving a pretty wide variety of seafoods.  They were a little late in joining the DeSoto family, but finally came into the fold on May 9th, 2015.  Having sampled all of DeSoto's other creations, I figured I'd give this place a shot.  I should preface this review by saying that my rating is closer to a 3.5, but I'm rounding up largely because of Chef Pete.  Super classy guy who answered pretty much all of my questions and explained his rotating menu (though he didn't give up all his trade secrets).  The prices are such that I can't give this place a super high mark yet, but my first visit gives me plenty of reason to be hopeful of this new upstart.\n\nAmong the items on Walrus & The Pearl's food menu include different types of oysters, shrimps, as well as other fish species.  Among the menu items that caught my attention during my first visit here was their pokes.  I've heard of poke (pronounced po-kay for those unfamiliar), which I know is huge in Hawaii and parts of Asia, but I've never sampled it for myself.  Essentially pokes are small bowls of raw fish that are covered with sea salt and an array of various marinades.  Today I decided to have a Yellowfin Tuna Poke.\n\nThe menu doesn't mention what was in the poke other than the tuna, so I did my best to figure it out on my own.  Aside from sea salt, I picked up sriracha, lemon juice, pepper, parsley, and scallions.  Might've been a few other items in there, but that's what I could make out.  The portion was fairly modest (though plenty for lunch), but about what I expected based on seeing poke dishes on the Food Network.  Overall, I was a big fan of this dish.  The sriracha gave it a little bit of a kick without being too spicy and the tuna tasted good enough to be sushi grade (who knows, maybe it was).  I also got a glass of the Pinor Noir.  I was pretty happy as I was the first one to have their Pinot Noir so they opened the bottle in front of me.  Refreshing accompaniment to the poke for sure.\n\nSo back to the drawback of this place.  The prices.  Total tab for the poke, glass of Pinot Noir, tax and tip came to $35.  Granted, I ordered one of the more expensive wines on their list.  But still, $15 for a glass of wine is pretty steep.  Most of their drink offerings are around $10 or less so don't let my experience scare you off on that front.  The prices of the seafood items themselves pretty much vary on which type of seafood you get and how much of it.  And as I mentioned earlier, the food menu rotates depending on what they have available so bear that in mind.\n\nTaken as a whole, Walrus & the Pearl has promise.  It remains to be seen whether this oyster bar/seafood restaurant concept can work when there are much cheaper offerings at DeSoto, but its certainly worth a try.  As mentioned Chef Pete is a super friendly guy and has been an apprentice of famed valley chef Stephen Jones (i.e. Blue Hound Kitchen, Yard Bird, etc.), so he's got the lineage to succeed.  Hopefully he's able to work out the menu to a price point that will make his oyster bar a regular mainstay for Downtown lunch and dinner crowds.  After all, taking risks are pretty much what every aspiring restauranteur at DeSoto is here to do.", "business_id": "CP0m_Y4VxX7q0BcBmXKkuw", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 4, "menu": 1, "date": "2015-05-10", "length": 627, "open": 0}

Here for recent brunch with a friend. It was the day after UW Men's basketball had a major win in the March Madness tournament, and, unfortunately, many of their staff called in sick that morning. (Hey Kids - if you're going to run with the big dogs, ya gotta get your butt out of bed the next day!) Brunch service was not top notch that day, but the manager who was both managing the floor and waiting tables was hustling and apologetic. \n\nI think the food is good, but not great. There are a lot of brunch places in Madison, many of which have signature items. Avenue offers a pancake flight, but none of the offerings appealed to me or my friend so I went with an eggs Benedict dish and my friend had French toast. The EB was good. I had a side of potatoes. The server asked if I wanted onions with my potatoes, and of course I did. The strange thing, though, is that the onions were clearly not skillet fried with the potatoes. They were cooked separately and thrown on top, but not in a good, garnish-like way. The flavors didn't blend together at all, which is odd, because onions and potatoes are usually a great marriage.\n\nThe place is good for groups and has a solid following, so I would return, but it's not a place I would suggest to others. There are many other better brunch options in Madison, starting with Eldorado Grill and Umami, which are only a few blocks away.", "business_id": "9ofDKryDCTnkAZXKzLcQ8w", "second": 0, "vegas": 0, "stars": 3, "menu": 0, "date": "2015-04-17", "length": 273, "open": 0}
