    "## iPython, Python, and our Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework, all subsequent homeworks, and your project will use iPython in a Jupyter notebook. iPython is just an interactive shell for programming in the Python language. A few years ago, the developers created a generic interactive shell called Jupyter that supports languages beyond just Python. This can be a bit confusing, and we'll add a bit to the confusion by referring to iPython and Jupyter interchangeably in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to Python, we do not expect you to have any prior experience. We do, however, expect you to have proficiency in some programming language (so you've seen loops, conditionals, functions, etc.) and a willingness to experiment and learn on your own. Python is a fun language and you should be able to pick up the necessary portions as we move along; however, this may require you to spend some extra cycles consulting online documentation, referring to a Python book, or scouring over StackOverflow. \n",
