    "\n",
    "## A Trust Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to adapt the classic Hubs-and-Authorities approach to allow us to find not the most trustful users. So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Epinions users and their trust network (so user = node, trust another user = edge). Epinions was a review website where users could review products (like on Amazon) but also provide a \"trust\" link to other users. Over this trust graph, we can apply the Hubs-and-Authorities approach to order the users according to both their hub scores and authority scores. The main idea is that a user who is trusted by other users is more \"trustful\". So, a user with high trustHub score connects to lots of trusted users. A user with high authorityHub score is trusted by lots of good hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four relations of the form (UserID1 trust UserID2):\n",
    "\n",
    "* teddiec trust jnbmoore\n",
    "* matta75 trust tallgent\n",
    "* nano trust dannec\n",
    "* craftswoman trust ifif1938\n",
    "\n",
    "So, \"teddiec\" is a node with a directed edge to the \"jnbmoore\" node. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide you with a file containing these kinds of trust relationships: \n",
    "\n",
    "*epinions_network_trust.txt*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph of users and trust edges based on this file. Your data structure should support calculating Hubs-and-Authorities, so think carefully about how you want to approach this part."
