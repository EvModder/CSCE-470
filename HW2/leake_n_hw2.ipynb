    "## A Trust Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to adapt the classic Hubs-and-Authorities approach to allow us to find not the most trustful users. So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Epinions users and their trust network (so user = node, trust another user = edge). Epinions was a review website where users could review products (like on Amazon) but also provide a \"trust\" link to other users. Over this trust graph, we can apply the Hubs-and-Authorities approach to order the users according to both their hub scores and authority scores. The main idea is that a user who is trusted by other users is more \"trustful\". So, a user with high trustHub score connects to lots of trusted users. A user with high authorityHub score is trusted by lots of good hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four relations of the form (UserID1 trust UserID2):\n",
    "\n",
    "* teddiec trust jnbmoore\n",
    "* matta75 trust tallgent\n",
    "* nano trust dannec\n",
    "* craftswoman trust ifif1938\n",
    "\n",
    "So, \"teddiec\" is a node with a directed edge to the \"jnbmoore\" node. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide you with a file containing these kinds of trust relationships: \n",
    "\n",
    "*epinions_network_trust.txt*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph of users and trust edges based on this file. Your data structure should support calculating Hubs-and-Authorities, so think carefully about how you want to approach this part."

    "Well I guess it's very multifaceted.  First part of my strategy was having my site up as early as possible. I think I dropped the chkstong page on my website within the first few minutes of the assignment appearing on Google Classrooms.  Immediately after that, I went and created a Reddit user (https://www.reddit.com/user/ChkstongYibbibi) and made/replied to some posts on the subject with other students from the class who were getting a head start.  After this, I went back to my website and wrote some details about the contest and other filler content (but none of it spam or meaningless since I know Google looks for and penalizes that kind of thing).  On my Chkstong page, I put up an offer to link to anyone's Chkstong page in return for them linking to mine, on the condition that their site wasn't spammy/gross (I didn't want to even remotely associate myself with spam sites).  I followed up on this with three different students, including the guy who ended up getting 1st place on Google.  After this I didn't really touch the site until the day the homework was due and the contest ended, at which point I removed content that was no longer relevant to the topic.  I also describe my strategy on-site in less detail than here.  Since I was kind of lazy I didn't bother putting up images or other media that might have helped my cause, but I did work on some basic link building from friends and other sites I controlled in a non-spammy way (example: \"Oh, and I'm in an SEO contest for the keyword ChkstongYibbibi over on this site\").  I didn't pay for anything other than the domain name I was already paying for (at ~5$ a year) and the time I put into the project.  I didn't bother to advertise at all so I only had ~20 organic clicks according to Google Search Console, so mostly I was relying on score from just having a well setup site without any nasty/spam."
